        <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
        <p class="policy-updated">Last updated: February 20, 2026</p>

        <h2>1. Agreement</h2>
        <p>These Terms & Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of WithoutMe ("the Service"), operated by Michael Cardin, sole proprietor ("we," "us," or "our"). By accessing or using the Service at withoutme.app, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.</p>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>WithoutMe is a web-based tool that allows users to create, manage, and share Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) with their team. The Service includes a free tier for individual use and a paid Pro tier that enables team sharing and cloud synchronization features.</p>

        <h2>3. Accounts</h2>
        <p>The Service can be used without creating an account. When you create an account, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your credentials and for all activity under your account. You must provide accurate information and keep it up to date.</p>

        <h2>4. Free and Paid Plans</h2>
        <p>The Service offers a free plan with core SOP creation features and a paid Pro plan with additional capabilities including team access and cloud sync. Pricing for the Pro plan is displayed on our website and may be updated from time to time. Any price changes will take effect at the start of the next billing cycle.</p>

        <h2>5. Payment and Billing</h2>
        <p>Paid subscriptions are billed monthly through our payment processor, Paddle (Paddle.com Market Limited). By subscribing to a paid plan, you authorize recurring charges to your payment method. Paddle acts as the Merchant of Record for all transactions.</p>

        <h2>6. Cancellation</h2>
        <p>You may cancel your paid subscription at any time. Upon cancellation, you will retain access to paid features until the end of your current billing period. After that, your account will revert to the free plan. Your SOPs and data will remain accessible on the free plan; team sharing and cloud sync features will be deactivated.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Content</h2>
        <p>You retain full ownership of all SOPs, procedures, and content you create using the Service. We do not claim any intellectual property rights over your content. You grant us a limited license to store and transmit your content solely for the purpose of providing the Service.</p>

        <h2>8. Acceptable Use</h2>

            <li>Transmit harmful, threatening, or illegal content</li>
            <li>Attempt to interfere with or compromise the integrity of the Service</li>
            <li>Distribute malware or other harmful software</li>
            <li>Impersonate any person or entity</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Data and Privacy</h2>
        <p>Your use of the Service is also governed by our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. On the free plan, your data is stored locally on your device. On the Pro plan, data is additionally stored in our cloud infrastructure to enable sync and team features.</p>

        <h2>10. Service Availability</h2>
        <p>We strive to keep the Service available at all times but do not guarantee uninterrupted access. The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We may perform maintenance, updates, or modifications that temporarily affect availability.</p>

        <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Michael Cardin, sole proprietor, and WithoutMe shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages resulting from your use of or inability to use the Service. Our total liability shall not exceed the amount you paid for the Service in the twelve months preceding the claim.</p>

        <h2>12. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>The Service is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>

        <h2>13. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify users of material changes by posting the updated Terms on this page with a revised "Last updated" date. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
