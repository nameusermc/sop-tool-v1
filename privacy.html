        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="policy-updated">Last updated: February 20, 2026</p>

        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how WithoutMe, operated by Michael Cardin, sole proprietor ("we," "us," or "our"), collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our Service at withoutme.app. We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data responsibly.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>Free Plan (No Account):</strong> When you use WithoutMe without an account, all data — including SOPs, steps, and checklist progress — is stored locally on your device using your browser's localStorage. We do not collect, transmit, or store any of this data on our servers.</p>

        <p><strong>With an Account (Pro Plan):</strong> When you create an account, we collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Email address</strong> — used for authentication and account-related communications</li>
            <li><strong>Password</strong> — stored securely as a hashed value (we never store plaintext passwords)</li>
            <li><strong>SOP content</strong> — synced to our cloud database (Supabase) to enable cross-device access and team sharing</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Payment Information:</strong> When you subscribe to a paid plan, payment is processed by Paddle (Paddle.com Market Limited), who acts as our Merchant of Record. We do not collect, store, or have access to your credit card number or payment details. Please refer to <a href="https://www.paddle.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paddle's Privacy Policy</a> for details on how they handle payment data.</p>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the Service</li>
            <li>Authenticate your identity and manage your account</li>
            <li>Synchronize your SOPs across devices (Pro plan)</li>
            <li>Enable team access to your shared SOPs (Pro plan)</li>
            <li>Communicate with you about your account or the Service</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>Account data and synced SOPs are stored using Supabase, a cloud database platform with industry-standard security practices including encryption at rest and in transit. Authentication is handled by Supabase Auth with secure password hashing.</p>
        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your data, but no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes. We share data only with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Supabase</strong> — our cloud infrastructure provider, for data storage and authentication</li>
            <li><strong>Paddle</strong> — our payment processor, for subscription billing</li>
            <li><strong>Vercel</strong> — our hosting provider, for serving the application</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We may also disclose information if required by law, regulation, or legal process.</p>

        <h2>6. Team Access and Shared Data</h2>
        <p>When you share SOPs with your team via invite links, team members can view and run checklists for your Active SOPs. Team members do not need accounts — their checklist progress is stored locally on their own devices. Team members cannot access your drafts, archived SOPs, or account information.</p>

        <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain your account data and synced SOPs for as long as your account is active. If you delete your account, we will delete your data from our servers within 30 days. Local data stored on your device is not affected by account deletion — you control that through your browser settings.</p>

        <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access</strong> your data — all your SOPs are visible in the app at all times</li>
            <li><strong>Export</strong> your data — use the PDF export feature for any SOP</li>
            <li><strong>Delete</strong> your data — delete individual SOPs or request full account deletion</li>
            <li><strong>Withdraw consent</strong> — stop using the Service at any time; your local data remains yours</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
        <p>WithoutMe does not use cookies for advertising or tracking. We use browser localStorage for application functionality (storing SOPs, preferences, and session state). We do not use third-party analytics or tracking tools.</p>

        <h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The Service is not intended for individuals under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will delete it.</p>

        <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated policy on this page with a revised "Last updated" date. Your continued use of the Service after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

        <h2>12. Contact</h2>
        <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or your data, please contact us at support@withoutme.app.</p>
