Log for Later (real but premature for current phase):
Everything else your tester raised falls into team/enterprise functionality that validates demand but shouldn't drive development yet:

Filter by author → requires multi-user, not applicable to single-user MVP
Read/write permissions → role-based access, enterprise feature
Customizable sidebar folders per user → multi-user personalization
Approval workflows (draft → review → publish) → team governance feature
Delete restrictions → ties into permissions/roles
Audit trail → change history, enterprise compliance feature
Pricing model feedback → valuable market intelligence for monetization planning


full feedback for context ---

The previous errors aren't there. I noticed the folders on the left sidebar do not change colors when you review its settings and pick a color. The icons seem to work fine. 

I tested what I could think to test. 
Create new SOPs, publish, archiving, deleting SOP, pasting steps, testing out the hashtags, and sort feature. 

Just some thoughts - 

Add to the sort feature - filter by author,

Will there be read/write permissions?  Example - in my company we make sure people get only the access they need. If they're not a contributor, they only get read access.,

 
Is it possible to allow the folders on the left sidebar to get adjusted. (Probably admin to make that change - or even a "per user" feature where they can adjust the folders.,

An approval feature - someone creates an SOP, they can only save it as a draft, and it is sent for approval to X and Y, and only after it has been approved, does the SOP get published.,

-Can anyone delete? It should be limited probably. 

Audit trail - is it possible to add audit trails? X person made a change on 02/29/2025. Or even more detailed, X person changed step 8 from "ssddvsd" to "vsdvdvs",

Pricing model - A company my employer is looking at has a model that is pretty neat. Subscription is 20k a year - it comes with a set number of admin accounts, approver accounts,  and something like 2,000 user read access only accounts. 

Anything over 8 (or whatever) admins incurs an additional fee each month per user, same with the read access only accounts. 

Though, now that I think about it, what's stopping people from sharing admin accounts.
