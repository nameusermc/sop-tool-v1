# WithoutAsking — Competitive Pricing Research
## Knowledge Management & AI Q&A Tools for Small Business Teams

*Last updated: February 24, 2026*
*Purpose: Inform pricing decisions for WithoutAsking launch*

## The Bottom Line

There is a massive pricing gap in the knowledge management market. Tools either cost nothing (and lack AI) or cost $120-800+/month (designed for enterprise). **Nobody offers a flat-rate, AI-first, upload-and-ask tool for small businesses at $9-19/month.** That's the gap WithoutAsking fills.

## Detailed Competitor Profiles

### Guru ($5-25/user/month)
- **Free tier:** Up to 3 users. After that, per-seat pricing kicks in.
- **Starter:** $5/user/mo (annual) or $6/user/mo (monthly) — basic wiki, no AI agents
- **Builder:** $10/user/mo (annual) or $12/user/mo (monthly) — custom branding, duplicate detection
- **Enterprise:** $25/user/mo — full AI, SSO, SCIM, advanced analytics
- **What they do well:** Card-based knowledge system, strong Slack/Teams integrations, automated content verification reminders, well-established brand
- **What they don't do well:** Per-user pricing balloons fast, migration from existing docs is a heavy lift, primarily enterprise-focused, editor is widely criticized, no simple "upload docs and ask questions" workflow
- **Key weakness for SMBs:** At $10/user × 15 people = $150/month just for Builder. Enterprise features cost $375/month. That's 17-42x what WithoutAsking charges.

### Slite ($8-25/user/month)
- **Free:** Up to 50 docs, 50 users — very limited
- **Standard:** $8/user/mo (annual) or $10/user/mo (monthly) — unlimited docs, limited AI
- **Knowledge Suite:** $25/user/mo — full AI "Ask" feature, enterprise search across tech stack
- **What they do well:** Clean UI/UX (widely praised), good collaborative editing, nice document organization
- **What they don't do well:** AI is severely limited on cheaper plans, knowledge is locked inside Slite (not your existing docs), per-user pricing scales linearly, minimum 10 users on Knowledge Suite
- **Key weakness for SMBs:** To get the AI Q&A feature ("Ask"), you need Knowledge Suite at $25/user. For 15 users = $375/month. The Standard plan's AI is a teaser, not a real feature.

### Tettra ($8.33-16.66/user/month)
- **Basic:** $4/user/mo — 10-user minimum, no AI
- **Scaling:** $8.33/user/mo (annual) — AI bot in Slack, AI answers, AI tagging. 10-user minimum.
- **Professional:** $7,200/year (covers first 50 users) — priority support, advanced permissions
- **What they do well:** Strong Slack integration (ask questions right in Slack), Q&A workflow, clean interface
- **What they don't do well:** Only integrates with Slack, Google Workspace, GitHub, and Zapier — very limited, 10-user minimum on all plans, Slack-dependent workflow
- **Key weakness for SMBs:** Requires minimum 10 users. If you have 10 users on Scaling, that's $83/month minimum. For 15 users = $125/month. Also, heavy Slack dependency — not every small business uses Slack.

### Helpjuice ($249-799/month)
- **Knowledge Base:** $249/mo — up to 30 users, NO AI features
- **AI-Knowledge Base:** $449/mo — up to 100 users, AI Writer + AI Search + AI Chatbot
- **Unlimited:** $799/mo — unlimited users, unlimited customization
- **No annual discount.** No free plan.
- **What they do well:** Extremely customizable design (they hand-design your KB for free), strong analytics, good search, long track record (since 2011)
- **What they don't do well:** Absurdly expensive for SMBs, AI locked behind $449+ plan, no free tier, admin interface feels dated
- **Key weakness for SMBs:** The cheapest plan is $249/month with NO AI. To get AI features: $449/month. That's 24-50x what WithoutAsking charges. Completely out of reach for a 15-person business.

### Document360 (Contact sales, was $149-299+/month)
- Removed public pricing in late 2024. Now "contact sales" for all plans.
- Previously: Professional ($149/mo), Business ($299/mo), Enterprise (custom)
- **What they do:** Full-featured knowledge base platform with AI writing, API documentation, multilingual support
- **Key weakness for SMBs:** Enterprise-focused, pricing is opaque and requires a sales call, massive feature set that SMBs don't need. Overkill in every dimension.

### Trainual ($249-499/month)
- **Small (1-25 employees):** $249/mo (annual) or $299/mo (monthly)
- **Medium (26-50 employees):** $279/mo (annual) or $349/mo (monthly)
- **Growth (up to 100 employees):** $419/mo (annual) or $499/mo (monthly)
- **What they do:** Combined SOP documentation + training/onboarding + knowledge base + LMS with quizzes and completion tracking. AI-powered search.
- **Key weakness:** Expensive. "Trainual alternative" and "Trainual too expensive" are heavily searched terms. Their target market (small businesses with SOPs) is exactly ours, and they're pricing themselves out of it.
- **Why this matters:** Trainual is the closest comparable in terms of target customer (SMB with 10-30 employees, needs SOPs and team knowledge). Their $249/month price point is the floor that most SMBs bounce off of. WithoutAsking at $9-19/month is 13-28x cheaper.

### Notion ($0-20/user/month)
- **Free:** Unlimited pages for solo use, limited for teams
- **Plus:** $10/user/mo — unlimited blocks/uploads, limited AI trial
- **Business:** $20/user/mo — full AI, SSO, private teamspaces
- **What they do well:** Incredibly flexible all-in-one workspace, massive user base, beautiful design
- **Why they're not direct competition:** Notion is a general workspace, not an AI Q&A tool. You can't upload a PDF and ask it questions. It's a wiki where you BUILD content in Notion's format. Also: full AI requires $20/user = $300/month for 15 people.

## Key Pricing Patterns in the Market

### 1. Per-Seat Pricing Dominates (and Punishes SMBs)
Almost every competitor uses per-user pricing. For enterprise teams of 500+, $10/user seems reasonable. For a 15-person plumbing company? $150-375/month for a knowledge base is absurd. **Flat-rate pricing is a genuine differentiator.**

### 2. AI is Either Missing or Expensive
On cheaper plans, AI is either nonexistent (Helpjuice $249, Tettra Basic) or severely limited (Slite Standard, Notion Plus). Full AI Q&A requires the premium tiers, which are always 2-3x the base price.

### 3. Minimum User Requirements
Tettra requires 10+ users on all plans. Slite requires 10+ users on Knowledge Suite. This locks out the smallest businesses. WithoutAsking's free tier (1 user) and Starter (up to 10) fills this gap.

### 4. Setup Complexity is a Hidden Cost
Most competitors require weeks of setup: migrating content, configuring integrations, training admins, setting up workflows. WithoutAsking's "upload a PDF, ask a question in 5 minutes" approach eliminates this entirely.

### 5. "Wiki-First" vs. "AI-First"
Every competitor built a wiki/knowledge base first and bolted AI on later. WithoutAsking is AI-first — the entire product is built around the Q&A loop. The documents are input; the AI answers are the product.

## Pricing Validation for WithoutAsking

### $9/month Starter — Is it too cheap?
- It's a no-brainer price point. Most SMB owners spend more on a single coffee run.
- Token costs per query: $0.008-0.015 typical, $0.03 worst case
- At 500 questions/month worst case: $15 in API costs. Margin is thin but positive.
- At typical usage (200-300 questions): ~$3-4 in API costs. Healthy margin.
- **The point of $9 is conversion, not margin.** Free → $9 is the easiest upgrade in SaaS. Once they're paying and getting value, upselling to $19 Pro is natural.

### $19/month Pro — Is it competitive?
- 2,000 questions/month, 25 team members
- Even at worst-case API costs (2,000 × $0.03 = $60), Supabase Pro ($25), and other infrastructure: breakeven is around $85-90/month in costs per Pro customer.
- But typical usage will be far lower. Most teams won't hit 2,000 questions.
- **$19/month for 25 team members vs. Guru at $10-25/user × 25 = $250-625/month.** The comparison sells itself.

### What if the market will bear more?
- Possibly. But the positioning is deliberate: "not $200/month." The price IS the marketing.
- V2 consideration: A "Business" tier at $39-49/month with department-based access, advanced analytics, and priority support could capture teams that outgrow Pro.

## Competitive Weaknesses to Exploit

### In Marketing/Copy
1. **"$9/month, not $200"** — The price comparison is the headline.
2. **"5 minutes, not 5 weeks"** — Setup time comparison.
3. **"Upload your docs, done"** — vs. rebuilding everything inside a new wiki.
4. **"Flat rate, not per seat"** — Same price for 2 or 10 team members.
5. **"AI that says I don't know"** — vs. wikis where you still have to search and read.

### In Product
1. **No minimum user requirements** — Anyone can start alone on Free.
2. **File upload, not content migration** — Use your existing docs, don't rewrite them.
3. **One thing done well** — Q&A from docs. Not a wiki, not a workspace, not an LMS.

## Risk: What if Guru/Slite/Notion launch a cheap plan?

**Low risk for several reasons:**
- Enterprise companies can't race to the bottom without cannibalizing existing revenue.
- Their per-seat model is baked into their architecture and investor metrics (ARPU).
- SMBs aren't their target market — support costs per dollar of revenue are higher for SMBs.
- WithoutAsking's advantage isn't just price — it's simplicity. Enterprise tools are bloated by design.

**The real competitive risk:** Another indie builder launching a similar $10/month tool. Mitigate with speed to market, the Without Suite ecosystem, and strong SEO/content positioning.
