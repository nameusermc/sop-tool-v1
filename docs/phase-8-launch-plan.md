# WithoutMe — Phase 8: Launch Prep & Customer Acquisition

## Current State

- **Product:** Complete. Phases 1–7 done. App is live, SEO pages deployed, PageSpeed 100/100/100/100.
- **Blocker:** Paddle domain approval pending. Once approved, payments go live and Pro tier is functional.
- **SEO:** Google has indexed manually submitted pages + privacy. 18 template pages + 4 blog posts + category page in sitemap (29 URLs). Targeting ~17,660/mo combined search volume across all pages.
- **Social:** @withoutmeapp claimed on TikTok and Instagram. Logo set, bios set. No content yet.
- **Audience:** Zero. No existing connections in the target market. No email list.
- **X/Twitter:** Account suspended on creation. Not pursuing — not a relevant channel for target audience.

## Phase 8 Goal

Prepare a data-driven launch strategy focused on the channels that actually convert for early-stage B2B SaaS:

1. **SEO (already built)** — monitor, optimize, expand
2. **Community engagement** — Facebook groups, Reddit, trade forums
3. **Google Ads (post-Paddle)** — small budget, high-intent keywords
4. **Social media** — minimal effort, credibility only

**Key data points driving this strategy:**
- SEO traffic converts at ~1.9% for SaaS (nearly 2x paid search)
- 71% of B2B researchers start with generic searches (exactly what template pages target)
- Early-stage SaaS (<$1M ARR) should allocate 60-70% effort to organic channels
- Paid social converts at <1% for B2B SaaS — awareness only, not acquisition
- Social media followers are a vanity metric at this stage
- At $39/mo x 12 months = $468 LTV → max ~$156 CAC to maintain 3:1 ratio

## Phase 8A — SEO Monitoring & Optimization

**Objective:** Track what's working, identify gaps, and make data-driven content decisions.

### 8A-1: Weekly Monitoring Routine (First 8 Weeks)

Every Monday, check:
- **Google Search Console → Performance tab**
  - Total impressions and clicks (track week over week)
  - Which queries are generating impressions (even without clicks)
  - Which pages are being shown
  - Average position for key terms
- **Google Search Console → Indexing tab**
  - How many pages are indexed vs submitted
  - Any crawl errors or "not indexed" issues
- **Google search:** `site:withoutme.app` — count indexed pages
- **Bing Webmaster Tools** — same checks (lower priority)

### 8A-2: Content Gap Analysis (After 4 Weeks of Data)

Once Search Console has data:
- Identify queries where WithoutMe appears at position 8-20 (page 1-2 border)
- These are "striking distance" keywords — small optimizations can push them onto page 1
- Look for queries you're ranking for that you didn't target — these reveal actual user language
- Check if any of the 12 unbuilt template pages from the keyword research are already getting impressions

### 8A-3: Content Expansion Decision (After 8 Weeks)

Based on real data, decide:
- Which existing pages need title/H1 tweaks to better match actual search queries?
- Which new template pages should be built next (prioritize by actual impression data, not just keyword planner estimates)?
- Are blog posts getting any traction, or should effort go elsewhere?

### Deliverables
- [ ] Monitoring checklist (weekly routine)
- [ ] Spreadsheet template for tracking impressions/clicks/positions week over week
- [ ] Decision framework for content expansion

## Phase 8B — Community Engagement (Facebook Groups & Reddit)

**Objective:** Get in front of trade business owners where they already ask questions. Build trust first, share the tool naturally second.

### 8B-1: Facebook Groups — Research & Join

Find and join 10-15 Facebook groups. Target categories:
- HVAC business owners / HVAC contractors
- Cleaning business owners / janitorial
- Plumbing business owners / plumbing contractors
- General home service business owners
- Landscaping business owners
- Small business operations / systems / delegation
- "How to run a service business" groups
- Pest control business owners
- Electrical contractor groups

**How to find them:** Search Facebook for "[industry] business owners" and "[industry] contractors." Sort by member count. Join groups with 1,000+ members that have recent activity.

### 8B-2: Reddit — Communities to Monitor

Subscribe and start participating:
- r/smallbusiness (1.5M+ members)
- r/sweatystartup (focused on service businesses)
- r/Entrepreneur
- r/HVAC (trade-specific)
- r/CommercialCleaning
- r/landscaping
- r/Plumbing
- r/electricians

### 8B-3: Engagement Timeline

**Weeks 1-2: Listen and participate (NO promotion)**
- Read posts daily. Understand what people ask about.
- Answer questions with genuine, helpful advice.
- Comment on others' posts. Be a normal community member.
- Note common pain points and language people use.

**Weeks 3-4: Value-first contributions**
- Start posting about your experience documenting procedures.
- Share insights about delegation, training, consistency — the problems WithoutMe solves.
- Do NOT link to the tool. Tell the story, not the product.

**Week 5+: Natural mentions when relevant**
- When someone asks "how do I get my team to stop calling me about everything" or "how do I train new employees" — answer the question fully, then mention the tool as one option.
- When someone asks for tool recommendations specifically — share it directly.
- Never post "check out my app" as a standalone post.

### 8B-4: Value-First Post Templates

5 post templates for Facebook groups (story-based, no links unless asked):

**Template 1 — The Repeated Question**
"I realized my team was asking me the same 5 questions every week. So I wrote down the answers as step-by-step procedures. Took an hour. Haven't been asked those questions since. If you're getting the same calls on your day off, just write down the steps. It's stupidly simple and I wish I'd done it years ago."

**Template 2 — The New Hire Problem**
"We hired a new guy last month and he was up to speed in 3 days instead of the usual 2 weeks. The difference? I had written procedures for every job type. He just followed the steps. No shadowing me for two weeks. If you're still training by 'ride along and watch' you're wasting your time and theirs."

**Template 3 — The Vacation Test**
"Took a week off last month. First time in 3 years I didn't get a single call. The only thing I changed was writing down how we do things — opening procedures, closing procedures, job-specific steps. My crew just followed the docs. If you can't take a week off without your phone blowing up, that's the fix."

**Template 4 — The Callback Reducer**
"We went from 3-4 callbacks a month to almost zero after I documented our job completion checklist. Turns out my guys weren't forgetting things because they were lazy — they just didn't have a consistent process. Once I wrote it down and made everyone follow the same steps, the mistakes stopped."

**Template 5 — The Bottleneck Realization**
"Someone in here asked me last week how I handle scheduling, dispatch, and QC for 15 employees. Honest answer: I don't anymore. I documented every process and handed them off. Took a few weekends to write everything down. Best investment of time I've ever made in this business."

### 8B-5: Response Templates

For when someone posts a question your tool directly solves:

**"How do I train new employees?"**
"Write down the steps for every job type you do. Literally step 1, step 2, step 3. Then hand that to the new hire on day one. It sounds too simple but it works. I use a free SOP tool called WithoutMe to keep them organized and let my crew access them from a link, but even a Google Doc works if you just need to start."

**"How do I get my guys to stop calling me?"**
"They call because the answer is in your head and not written anywhere else. Pick the 5 things they call about most and write step-by-step procedures for each one. Share those with the team. Calls drop immediately. I went through this exact process — happy to share what worked."

**"Is there a good checklist app for service businesses?"**
"I use WithoutMe (withoutme.app) — it's built specifically for service businesses. You create SOPs as step-by-step procedures and your team runs them as checklists from a link. No app download, no account needed for them. Free to start. They also have templates for [their industry] if you want a head start."

### Deliverables
- [ ] List of 10-15 Facebook groups (with links and member counts)
- [ ] List of Reddit communities
- [ ] Engagement timeline printed / pinned for reference
- [ ] 5 value-first post templates
- [ ] 5 response templates for common questions
- [ ] Weekly time commitment: 20-30 min/day browsing and commenting

## Phase 8C — Google Ads Prep (Post-Paddle)

**Objective:** Have a campaign ready to launch the day Paddle approves. Small budget, high-intent keywords only.

### 8C-1: Campaign Strategy

- **Budget:** $5-10/day ($150-300/month)
- **Type:** Search only (no display, no video)
- **Targeting:** US only
- **Goal:** Clicks to withoutme.app landing page

### 8C-2: Keyword Targets (From Existing Research)

High-intent, low-competition keywords you already have data on:

| Keyword | Monthly Searches | Est. CPC |
|---------|-----------------|----------|
| cleaning business checklist | 210 | TBD |
| hvac checklist | 110 | TBD |
| house cleaning checklist template | 2,400 | TBD |
| sop template small business | ~50 | TBD |
| plumbing checklist | 40 | TBD |
| pest control checklist | 40 | TBD |
| hvac maintenance checklist template | 70 | TBD |

Start with 5-10 keywords. Exact match and phrase match only — no broad match (burns budget fast).

### 8C-3: Ad Copy Drafts

**Ad 1 — Generic**
Headline: Free Checklists for Service Businesses
Description: Create step-by-step procedures your team can follow. No signup required. Templates for 18 industries.

**Ad 2 — Cleaning**
Headline: Cleaning Business Checklists — Free
Description: Step-by-step procedures for house cleaning, deep cleaning, move-out. Your team follows the checklist. Free to start.

**Ad 3 — HVAC**
Headline: HVAC Maintenance Checklists — Free
Description: Furnace inspection, AC tune-up, install procedures. Your crew follows the steps without calling you. Free to start.

### 8C-4: Tracking Setup

- Add Google Analytics (GA4) to withoutme.app if not already present
- Set up conversion tracking: "SOP created" event (or "signup" if possible)
- UTM parameters on all ad URLs: `?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=[campaign_name]`
- Track cost per signup, not just cost per click

### 8C-5: Decision Framework

After 2 weeks ($70-140 spent):
- If cost per click > $5 on a keyword → pause it
- If a keyword gets clicks but no signups → check landing page alignment
- If a keyword converts → increase budget on that keyword
- If nothing converts at all → pause campaign, revisit after more SEO data

### Deliverables
- [ ] Google Ads account created and ready
- [ ] Campaign structure (1 campaign, 3 ad groups by industry)
- [ ] 5-10 keywords with match types
- [ ] 3 ad copy variants
- [ ] GA4 + conversion tracking setup guide
- [ ] UTM parameter convention documented
- [ ] 2-week review decision framework

## Phase 8D — Social Media (Minimal Maintenance)

**Objective:** Keep TikTok and Instagram profiles alive with minimal effort. These exist for credibility, not acquisition.

### 8D-1: Content Plan

**What to post:**
- Screenshots of the app (creating an SOP, running a checklist, template hub)
- Screenshots of template pages for specific industries
- Pain point quotes as text images ("If your team calls you on every day off, the problem isn't your team.")
- Milestone posts ("18 free checklist templates, live now")
- Repurposed snippets from blog posts

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't grind for followers
- Don't post daily
- Don't stress about engagement numbers
- Don't invest time in video production

### 8D-2: Posting Cadence

- **Launch week:** 3 posts (one "what this is" post, one screenshot, one pain point)
- **Ongoing:** 1-2 posts per week maximum
- **Batch them:** Spend 30 minutes once a week creating the next week's posts

### 8D-3: Screenshot Guide

Take clean screenshots of:
- Landing page hero section
- SOP editor with a real SOP filled in
- Checklist runner with some steps checked
- Template hub page
- An industry template page (e.g., cleaning)
- AI suggest steps in action (if you have Pro access in sandbox)

Use these as rotating content. One screenshot with a short caption is a post.

### Deliverables
- [ ] 6-8 app screenshots ready to post
- [ ] 10 pain point captions (text overlays or plain text posts)
- [ ] 1 "what is WithoutMe" intro post for each platform
- [ ] Simple posting schedule (weekly, not daily)

---

- Continue Facebook group engagement (20-30 min/day)
- Post 1-2x/week on social
- Check Search Console weekly
- Respond to every comment, DM, and support email personally
- Track: signups, SOPs created, any Pro conversions

### Metrics That Matter

| Metric | Where to Track | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Pages indexed | Google Search Console | Are your SEO pages being found? |
| Organic impressions | Google Search Console | Are people seeing your pages in results? |
| Organic clicks | Google Search Console | Are people clicking through? |
| Signups | Supabase dashboard | Are visitors becoming users? |
| SOPs created | Supabase / app data | Are users getting value? |
| Google Ads CPC | Google Ads | Is paid traffic affordable? |
| Google Ads conversions | GA4 | Is paid traffic converting? |
| Pro conversions | Paddle dashboard | Is anyone paying? |

### Metrics That DON'T Matter (Right Now)

- Social media followers
- Social media likes
- TikTok views
- Instagram reach
- Number of Facebook group posts
