        <h1>Simple SOP Software for Service Businesses</h1>
        <p>Most SOP tools are built for corporate teams with IT departments and training budgets. You just need your crew to follow the steps.</p>
    </section>

    <div class="tp-container">
        <p>You searched for SOP software. That means you already know your business needs written procedures — steps your team can follow so work gets done right whether you're on the job or not. The problem isn't that SOP tools don't exist. The problem is that most of them weren't built for you.</p>

        <h2>Why most SOP software doesn't work for service businesses</h2>
        <p>The SOP software market is dominated by tools built for corporate teams — tech companies with 200 employees, HR departments rolling out compliance training, enterprise organizations with dedicated process managers. Those tools work great for those teams. They don't work for an HVAC company with 15 techs, a cleaning business with 12 crews, or a plumber with 8 employees.</p>
        <p>Here's what you run into:</p>

        <div class="problem-block">
            <h3>You can't even try it without a sales call</h3>
            <p>Most SOP platforms hide behind a "book a demo" button. You can't see the product, can't test it with your team, can't figure out if it works for you — until you sit through a 30-minute pitch. You run a service business. You don't have time for demo calls. You need to see the tool, try it, and decide in 10 minutes whether it's worth using.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="problem-block">
            <h3>The pricing assumes corporate budgets</h3>
            <p>Enterprise SOP tools run $99 to $249 per month. Some charge per user on top of that. For a 20-person service company, you could be looking at $300-500 a month just to write down how you do things. That's a truck payment. No service business owner is going to pay enterprise software prices for a documentation tool — especially before they've seen it work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="problem-block">
            <h3>They're built for desk workers, not field teams</h3>
            <p>Most SOP platforms assume everyone has a company laptop and a company email. Your crew is on job sites with a phone in their pocket. They're not going to create accounts, download apps, or log into a portal. They need to tap a link and see the procedure. Anything more complicated than that and they'll just call you instead — which is the whole problem you're trying to solve.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="problem-block">
            <h3>Too many features you'll never use</h3>
            <p>Workflow automation. Approval chains. Role-based permissions. Analytics dashboards. Version history with tracked changes. These features exist because enterprise buyers need them for compliance and governance. You need a way to write steps and share them with your team. The extra complexity makes the tool harder to learn, slower to set up, and more expensive to run — for features that have nothing to do with getting your crew to follow a checklist.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tp-cta-box">
            <h3>Skip the demo. Start building.</h3>
            <p>WithoutMe lets you create step-by-step procedures right now — no signup, no sales call, no credit card. Your team clicks a link and sees the steps.</p>
            <a href="/" class="tp-cta-btn">Start building — it's free</a>
            <p class="tp-cta-note">No signup required. No credit card. Just start.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>What SOP software should look like for trades</h2>
        <p>If you're running a service business with 10-30 employees, you need something fundamentally different from what the enterprise market offers. Here's what actually matters:</p>

        <p><strong>Start immediately.</strong> Open the tool, start writing steps. No account creation, no onboarding wizard, no waiting for an admin to provision your workspace. If you have 20 minutes between jobs, that's enough to document a procedure.</p>

        <p><strong>Share with a link.</strong> Your team members tap a link and see the procedure. No app download, no account, no login. They're on a job site — they need the steps, not a software tutorial.</p>

        <p><strong>Work offline.</strong> Job sites don't always have great signal. Your procedures should be accessible whether your team has internet or not. Sync when you're connected, work when you're not.</p>

        <p><strong>Price it for small business.</strong> A documentation tool should cost less than a single service call, not more than your truck insurance. Free to start, with a paid tier that's under $50 a month for everything including unlimited team members.</p>

        <p><strong>Templates for your industry.</strong> Generic SOP templates written for office workers don't help a plumber or a landscaper. Industry-specific templates with real steps save setup time and show you what good procedures look like for your trade.</p>

        <h2>WithoutMe is built for this</h2>
        <p>WithoutMe exists because nobody was building SOP software for service businesses. Every tool in the market targets enterprise teams, charges enterprise prices, and assumes enterprise workflows. That leaves a gap for the HVAC company that just needs a service call checklist, the cleaning business that wants consistent quality across crews, and the landscaping company that's tired of training every new hire from scratch.</p>

        <p>Here's how it works: you open the app and start creating a procedure. Add a title, write your steps, and you're done. Share it with your team via a link — they click it and see the steps immediately. No account required for your team members. Run it as a checklist so people can check off steps as they go.</p>

        <p>The free plan gives you unlimited SOPs, <a href="/sop-templates/" style="color: #4338ca;">18 industry-specific templates</a>, PDF export, and offline access. The Pro plan adds AI-powered step generation, team sharing, and cloud sync for $39 a month — flat, no per-seat fees.</p>

        <p>That's it. No workflow automation, no approval chains, no analytics dashboard. Just procedures and checklists, built for the people who actually do the work.</p>

        <h2>Getting started</h2>
        <p>If you're ready to try it, just <a href="/" style="color: #4338ca;">open the app and start building</a>. No signup, no credit card, no demo call. You'll have your first procedure written in 10 minutes.</p>

        <p>If you want a head start, grab a template for your industry. Each one comes with real procedures you can customize and use immediately:</p>
