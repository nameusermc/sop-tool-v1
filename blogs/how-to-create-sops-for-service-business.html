        <h1>How to Create SOPs for Your Service Business</h1>
        <p>A step-by-step guide to documenting your procedures — so your team can do the work without asking you every time.</p>
    </section>

    <div class="tp-container">
        <h2>What's an SOP and why should you care?</h2>
        <p>SOP stands for Standard Operating Procedure. In plain English: it's a written set of steps that tells someone exactly how to do a specific task in your business. That's it. No corporate jargon required.</p>
        <p>If you run a service business — HVAC, cleaning, plumbing, landscaping, whatever — you already have procedures. They're just in your head. Or in the heads of your best employees. The problem is, what happens when you're not there? Or when that experienced employee leaves? Or when you hire someone new and they have to learn everything from scratch?</p>
        <p>Written SOPs solve that. They turn "ask the boss" into "follow the steps." And they let you stop being the person who has to answer the same question for the fifteenth time.</p>

        <h2>The 6-step process</h2>
        <p>Here's how to create your first SOP. This works whether you're documenting how to close out an HVAC service call, how to clean a commercial kitchen, or how to onboard a new employee.</p>

        <div class="step-block">
            <h3>Step 1: Pick the right task to document first</h3>
            <p>Don't start with everything. Start with one task. Pick the one that causes the most problems — the task your team does inconsistently, the one that generates customer complaints, or the one you're most tired of explaining.</p>
            <p>Good first SOPs for most service businesses: your core service delivery procedure (the thing you do on every job), your new employee first-day process, or your end-of-day closeout. These get used immediately and prove the value of having written procedures.</p>
            <p>Bad first SOPs: anything you do once a year, anything that's unique every time, or anything that requires extensive professional judgment with no repeatable steps.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step-block">
            <h3>Step 2: Do the task (or watch someone do it)</h3>
            <p>Don't write the SOP from memory. Actually do the task, or watch your best employee do it, and write down every step as it happens. You'll catch steps you've been doing on autopilot for years — the ones you'd forget to mention if someone asked you to explain the process.</p>
            <p>If you're watching someone else, don't correct them while they work. Just observe and take notes. You want to document what actually happens, not what you think should happen. You can fix the gaps later.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step-block">
            <h3>Step 3: Write it as if the reader is brand new</h3>
            <p>The biggest mistake people make with SOPs is assuming too much knowledge. You've done this task a thousand times, so you skip the "obvious" steps. But those obvious steps are exactly what a new hire needs.</p>
            <p>Write each step as a single action someone can complete without guessing. "Clean the kitchen" isn't a step — it's a project. "Wipe all countertops with the blue all-purpose cleaner, then wipe dry with a clean microfiber cloth" is a step.</p>
            <p>Use the language your team actually uses. If your crew calls it a "walkthrough" instead of a "pre-service inspection," write "walkthrough." SOPs that sound like a legal document don't get read.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step-block">
            <h3>Step 4: Put the steps in order</h3>
            <p>This sounds obvious, but the order matters more than you think. Some tasks have a strict sequence — you can't paint before you prep. Others have steps that can be done in any order but work best in a specific flow.</p>
            <p>Organize your steps so the person doing the work can start at step 1 and work straight through to the end without jumping back. If a step requires something from an earlier step, make sure that earlier step comes first.</p>
            <p>Keep the total number of steps between 5 and 15 for most tasks. If you have more than 15, you're probably documenting multiple tasks in one SOP. Split it up. A "Full Service Call Procedure" is better as three separate SOPs: "Pre-Service Prep," "Service Execution," and "Post-Service Closeout."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step-block">
            <h3>Step 5: Test it on someone who hasn't done the task</h3>
            <p>Hand the SOP to someone and ask them to follow it. Ideally someone new or someone who doesn't normally do this task. Watch them work through it without helping. Where they get confused, the SOP needs more detail. Where they skip something or do it wrong, the SOP needs clearer language.</p>
            <p>This is where most SOPs go from rough to useful. You'll find missing steps you forgot to write down, assumptions that need to be spelled out, and steps that are too vague to follow. Fix them, then test again.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step-block">
            <h3>Step 6: Share it and actually use it</h3>
            <p>An SOP buried in a binder in the office is worthless. Your team needs to access it where they do the work — on their phone at a job site, on a tablet in the shop, on a screen at the front desk.</p>
            <p>Share SOPs as links your team can pull up any time. Use them during training. Reference them when someone does a task wrong — "here's the procedure, let's look at step 4 together" is more productive than "I already told you how to do this."</p>
            <p>Update them when things change. A procedure that was accurate six months ago but no longer matches reality is worse than no procedure at all, because people stop trusting the documentation.</p>
        </div>

        </div>

        <h2>What to document first</h2>
        <p>Once your first SOP is working, expand to these high-impact procedures. Every service business benefits from having these written down, regardless of industry.</p>
        <p><strong>Core service delivery</strong> — the main thing your business does on every job. For an HVAC company, that's a service call procedure. For a cleaning company, that's a standard clean checklist. For a plumber, that's a diagnostic and repair procedure. This is the one that affects customer experience the most.</p>
        <p><strong>New employee first day</strong> — what happens from the moment they walk in. Where things are, who to talk to, what tools they need, what they shadow first. Good onboarding SOPs cut training time dramatically because the new person isn't waiting around for someone to tell them what to do next.</p>
        <p><strong>Quality check before leaving a job</strong> — the inspection your team does before calling a job complete. This catches mistakes before the customer sees them and reduces callbacks. It's the single most cost-effective SOP for any service business.</p>
        <p><strong>Customer complaint handling</strong> — how to respond when something goes wrong. This one protects your reputation and your team's confidence. When there's a clear procedure for handling complaints, your team doesn't freeze up or make things worse by improvising.</p>
        <p><strong>Equipment and vehicle maintenance</strong> — routine checks that prevent breakdowns. A truck that won't start costs you a day of revenue. A checklist that catches low oil or worn tires costs you five minutes.</p>

        <h2>Common mistakes to avoid</h2>
        <p><strong>Writing a novel instead of a checklist.</strong> Your team isn't going to read three paragraphs of context before each step. Write short, clear steps. Save the "why" for training conversations — the SOP itself should be scannable.</p>
        <p><strong>Documenting everything at once.</strong> You don't need 50 SOPs on day one. Start with 3-5 high-impact procedures, get your team using them, then expand. Trying to document everything at once means nothing gets finished and nothing gets used.</p>
        <p><strong>Writing it yourself without input.</strong> Your team knows things about how the work gets done that you don't see from the owner's chair. Involve your best people in writing and reviewing SOPs. They'll catch gaps you miss, and they'll use procedures they helped create.</p>
        <p><strong>Making it hard to access.</strong> If your SOPs live in a shared drive folder that requires a company login on a desktop computer, your field team will never look at them. Put them where the work happens — on phones, accessible via a simple link, no login required.</p>
