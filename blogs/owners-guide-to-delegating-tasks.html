        <h1>The Owner's Guide to Delegating Tasks That Actually Stick</h1>
        <p>Why delegation fails in service businesses — and the practical fix that doesn't require becoming a management expert.</p>
    </section>

    <div class="tp-container">
        <p>You've tried delegating. You handed off a responsibility to someone on your team, they did it wrong or half-way, and you ended up doing it yourself anyway. Now you think delegation doesn't work with your crew, or that your employees just aren't ready for it.</p>
        <p>Here's the uncomfortable truth: delegation usually fails because of how the task was handed off, not because of who it was handed to. If you say "handle the supply ordering from now on" without defining what "handle" means, you're not delegating — you're hoping.</p>

        <h2>Why delegation fails in service businesses</h2>
        <p>Service business owners are usually doers. You built the business by being the best at the work. You know exactly how things should be done because you've done them yourself for years. When you hand something to someone else and they don't do it the way you would, it feels like proof that nobody else can do it right.</p>
        <p>But the real problem is the gap between what's in your head and what your team has access to. You know the supply order should go in by Thursday so it arrives by Monday. You know to check the minimum quantities against the schedule for next week. You know to use Vendor A for chemicals and Vendor B for equipment because the pricing is better. Your employee knows none of this — you just said "handle the ordering."</p>
        <p>That gap is the delegation killer. And the fix is simple: close the gap with a written procedure before you hand off the task.</p>

        <h2>The delegation framework that works</h2>

        <h3>1. Write the procedure before you hand it off</h3>
        <p>Before you delegate anything, document exactly how you do it. Every step, every decision point, every "obvious" thing you do on autopilot. Write it as if the reader has never done this before — because from their perspective, they haven't done it your way before.</p>
        <p>This takes 20-30 minutes for most tasks. It feels like overhead. But consider the alternative: you spend 20 minutes explaining it verbally, the person forgets half of what you said, does it wrong, you explain it again, they get it mostly right but miss one thing, and three weeks later you're still fielding questions about a task you thought you'd delegated.</p>
        <p>Twenty minutes writing a procedure once beats twenty minutes of re-explaining every week for months.</p>

        <h3>2. Walk through it together, once</h3>
        <p>Don't just email the procedure. Walk through it with the person the first time they do the task. Let them do the work while you observe. Point out the steps as they go. Answer questions in real-time and update the procedure with anything that wasn't clear.</p>
        <p>This is the one time you invest in showing someone the process. After this, they have the written procedure to reference. You're not available for questions about this task anymore — the procedure is.</p>

        <h3>3. Define "done" — not just "do"</h3>
        <p>The most common delegation failure is assuming the other person knows what a good result looks like. They don't. You need to tell them explicitly.</p>
        <p>"Order supplies" has no definition of done. "Submit the supply order by Thursday 5 PM, email me the order confirmation, and update the inventory spreadsheet" has a clear definition. When someone knows exactly what the finished product looks like, they can self-check their work before bringing it to you.</p>

        <h3>4. Set checkpoints, not check-ins</h3>
        <p>Micromanaging a delegated task defeats the purpose. But completely letting go of something you care about is hard. The middle ground is checkpoints — predetermined moments where you review the output.</p>
        <p>For the supply ordering example: "Send me the order for review before you submit it for the first three weeks. After that, just submit it and send me the confirmation." You verify quality at the start, build trust, and then step back. The person doing the task knows exactly when you're looking and when they're on their own.</p>

        <h3>5. Accept "different" as long as the result is right</h3>
        <p>This is the hardest part for most owners. The person you delegate to will not do it exactly the way you do it. They'll do step 3 before step 2. They'll use a different spreadsheet format. They'll order from a slightly different vendor. If the end result meets the standard you defined, let it go.</p>
        <p>Delegation means giving someone the outcome and the guidelines, not dictating every motion. If you can't accept that the path might look different as long as the destination is the same, you're not ready to delegate — you're ready to clone yourself, which isn't an option.</p>

        <div class="tp-cta-box">
            <h3>Document your procedures, then hand them off</h3>
            <p>WithoutMe lets you build step-by-step procedures your team can reference any time. Write the procedure once, share it via a link, and delegate with confidence.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>What to delegate first</h2>
        <p>Start with tasks that are repeatable, have a clear process, and currently eat your time every week. Don't start with your most complex, judgment-heavy work — start with the stuff that has a definable procedure.</p>
        <p><strong>Good first delegations:</strong> supply ordering, vehicle maintenance checks, end-of-day closeout, new client intake paperwork, scheduling confirmations, equipment inventory, social media posting, invoice follow-ups.</p>
        <p><strong>Wait on these:</strong> customer pricing decisions, hiring, large purchase approvals, client relationship management, strategic planning. These require judgment and context that takes longer to transfer. Delegate the procedural tasks first to free up your time for the judgment calls that actually need you.</p>

        <h2>The compound effect</h2>
        <p>Every task you successfully delegate frees up time. Use that time to document and delegate the next task. Within a few months, you'll have handed off dozens of recurring tasks that used to eat your day. Your team will be more capable, more confident, and less dependent on you for every decision.</p>
        <p>That's not just better for you — it's better for them. People want to do good work. They just need clear instructions and permission to own the task. Written procedures give them both.</p>
