        <h2>Why Salons Need Written Procedures</h2>
        <p>Salons live and die on client experience. One stylist who skips the consultation, one station that isn't properly sanitized between clients, one color that's mixed wrong — and you've lost a client who's been coming for years. Written checklists keep every stylist following the same standards, especially when you're not standing behind them watching.</p>
        <p>These procedures cover the workflows every salon needs documented. They're written for real salon operations — not cosmetology school textbooks.</p>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>✂️ Between-Client Station Reset</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The turnaround procedure between every single appointment — no exceptions.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Sweep all hair from the floor around and under your chair immediately. Don't wait for it to accumulate — the next client shouldn't see the last client's hair.</li>
                <li>Remove used cape and replace with a clean one. Capes go in the laundry bin, not back on the hook. If you're low on clean capes, tell the front desk now, not when the next client sits down.</li>
                <li>Disinfect all tools used: combs, brushes, clips, shears. Remove hair from combs and brushes first, then soak in EPA-registered disinfectant for the required contact time. Wipe shears with disinfectant spray.</li>
                <li>Wipe down the station counter, mirror, and chair with disinfectant. Include the armrests and the footrest — these are contact surfaces clients notice.</li>
                <li>Clean the shampoo bowl if you used it: remove all hair from the drain screen, wipe the bowl and neck rest with disinfectant, and make sure the towel is fresh.</li>
                <li>Restock your station: fresh towels within reach, product you'll need for the next service, clean tools laid out. Being unprepared when the client sits down looks unprofessional and costs you time.</li>
                <li>Check yourself: apron clean, hands washed. Greet the next client at the front, not from your station.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>💬 New Client Consultation Checklist</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The conversation every stylist has with a new client before touching their hair.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Introduce yourself. Ask what brought them in and what they're looking for today. Let them talk first — don't jump straight into what you think they should do.</li>
                <li>Ask about their hair history: current color (natural or treated), recent chemical services (color, perm, relaxer, keratin), how long since their last cut, and any products they use regularly.</li>
                <li>Allergy and sensitivity screening: have they had reactions to hair color, bleach, or any salon products before? For color services, this is required — not optional. Follow your state board guidelines on patch testing.</li>
                <li>Look at reference photos together. Confirm your understanding of what they want. Be direct about what's realistic — if the reference requires three sessions to achieve safely, say so now. Surprises at checkout destroy trust.</li>
                <li>Assess the hair: condition, texture, elasticity, porosity. Run your fingers through it. This tells you what products and techniques will work and what to avoid. Share your assessment with the client in plain language.</li>
                <li>Set expectations: how long the service will take, the cost, and what maintenance will be needed. Get verbal agreement before starting. If it's more expensive or time-consuming than they expected, give them a chance to adjust.</li>
                <li>Note their preferences in their client profile: favorite products, allergies, styling preferences, beverage of choice, anything personal they mentioned. This information makes their next visit feel remembered.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>🎨 Color Mixing & Application Standards</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The procedure that ensures color consistency and prevents costly mistakes.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Pull the client's color formula from their profile before they arrive. If it's a new color, finalize the formula during consultation — not at the mixing station with the client waiting.</li>
                <li>Verify you have the correct products and shades before mixing. Running to the back room mid-application because you're out of a shade is disruptive and unprofessional.</li>
                <li>Mix color exactly to the manufacturer's ratio. Use a scale for precision — eyeballing developer ratios leads to inconsistent results. Record the exact formula including brand, shade numbers, developer volume, and any additives.</li>
                <li>Apply a barrier cream along the hairline, ears, and neck to prevent skin staining. This takes 30 seconds and prevents the client from leaving with color on their forehead.</li>
                <li>Apply color in consistent sections per the technique required. Set a timer for the processing time specified by the manufacturer. Check color development at the halfway point and before rinsing.</li>
                <li>Rinse thoroughly until water runs clear. Apply the appropriate post-color treatment — color-safe conditioner, toner, or glaze per the service. Style as discussed during consultation.</li>
                <li>Update the client's color record with today's formula, timing, and results. Note any adjustments for next time. A good color record means you can reproduce the exact result months later.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>🔑 Salon Opening & Closing Procedures</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The daily bookend routines that keep the salon running smoothly for staff and clients.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Opening: arrive 20 minutes before the first appointment. Unlock, disarm security, turn on lights and music. Set the thermostat — the salon should be comfortable when the first client walks in, not still warming up.</li>
                <li>Walk the salon floor: every station clean, mirrors spotless, chairs in position. Check the reception area — tidy, magazines current, retail displays neat. First impressions happen in the first 5 seconds.</li>
                <li>Start the coffee/beverage station. Check the restroom — stocked and clean. Turn on any display screens or digital signage.</li>
                <li>Review the day's schedule: any new clients, any complex color services, any double-bookings to manage. Confirm all scheduled stylists are accounted for. If someone's calling out, adjust the book now.</li>
                <li>Closing: last client out, final sweep and mop of all floors. Each stylist cleans and disinfects their own station — this is non-negotiable, not something the opening staff should inherit.</li>
                <li>Laundry: all used towels and capes started in the wash or prepped for morning. Disinfectant solution containers emptied, cleaned, and refilled with fresh solution. Tools soaking overnight as needed.</li>
                <li>Close the register, run the end-of-day report, reconcile cash. Turn off all appliances — flat irons, curling irons, color processors, steamers. Check the back room. Lock up, set the alarm.</li>
            </ol>

        </div>

        <h2>Tips for Salon SOPs That Actually Get Used</h2>
        <p>Stylists are creative people — they didn't get into this business to follow checklists. The key is to frame your procedures around the outcomes they care about: happy clients, good reviews, repeat business. A "sanitation checklist" sounds tedious. "The between-client reset that keeps clients coming back" connects the procedure to the result.</p>
        <p>Keep checklists short and specific to one task. A station reset checklist, a consultation checklist, a closing checklist — each one separate, each one completable in minutes. Stylists won't scroll through a 20-step master document between clients.</p>
        <p>Build your procedures around your state board requirements. Sanitation and disinfection standards aren't suggestions — they're the law. When compliance is built into the daily checklist, you're always inspection-ready without a scramble.</p>

        <h2>Other Procedures Worth Documenting</h2>
        <p>Beyond daily operations, most salons benefit from documenting: product recommendation and upselling approach, handling dissatisfied clients and redos, retail inventory and ordering, new stylist onboarding and shadow shifts, social media photo policies and posting, and chemical safety and spill handling. Each one reduces the situations where a stylist has to guess what to do.</p>
