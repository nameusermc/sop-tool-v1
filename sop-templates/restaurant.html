        <p>Opening checklists, cleaning procedures, and kitchen SOPs your staff follows every shift — so service stays consistent when you're not there.</p>

        <h2>Why Restaurants Need Written SOPs and Checklists</h2>
        <p>Restaurants run on repetition. The same opening tasks, the same cleaning routines, the same closing procedures — every single shift. When those routines live in people's heads instead of on paper, things get skipped. The line doesn't get properly sanitized, the walk-in temps don't get checked, the bathrooms get a quick wipe instead of a real clean. Written SOPs turn your standards into checklists your staff actually follows.</p>
        <p>These templates cover the procedures every restaurant needs documented. They're written for real restaurant operations — not food service corporate manuals that nobody reads.</p>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>☀️ Restaurant Opening Checklist</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">Everything that needs to happen between unlocking the door and seating the first customer.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Unlock and disarm the security system. Turn on all lights including kitchen hoods, dining room, restrooms, and exterior signage.</li>
                <li>Check walk-in cooler and freezer temperatures. Log them. If anything is out of range, assess product safety before the kitchen starts prep. Don't just turn the dial and hope — check the food.</li>
                <li>Turn on all kitchen equipment: ovens, flattop, fryers, steam tables. Allow proper preheat time before service — rushing this leads to inconsistent food.</li>
                <li>Kitchen opening: check prep list against par levels. Pull proteins to thaw if needed. Set up all stations with mise en place. Verify all sauces, dressings, and sides are prepped and portioned.</li>
                <li>Front-of-house: check today's reservation list and any large party notes. Set tables — silverware, napkins, menus, condiments. Check that salt and pepper shakers are full, sugar caddies stocked.</li>
                <li>Restrooms: check soap, paper towels, toilet paper. Wipe counters, mirrors, and fixtures. If the restroom isn't ready at open, it won't improve during a busy shift.</li>
                <li>POS system: open the day, verify menu items and pricing are correct, check that all printers are connected and printing. Run a test ticket to the kitchen.</li>
                <li>Walkthrough: stand at the front door and look at the restaurant as a customer would. Lights working? Music on? Floor clean? Tables straight? Fix it now.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>🧼 Kitchen Cleaning & Sanitation Checklist</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The cleaning procedure that keeps your kitchen health-inspection ready at all times.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Sanitize all cutting boards and prep surfaces between proteins. Never use the same board for raw chicken and vegetables without sanitizing. This isn't optional.</li>
                <li>Clean and sanitize the line between lunch and dinner service. Wipe down all surfaces, swap out cutting boards, replace sanitizer buckets with fresh solution.</li>
                <li>Fryers: filter oil at end of each shift. Full oil change on the weekly schedule. Wipe down the exterior — grease buildup is a fire hazard and an inspection flag.</li>
                <li>Flattop and grill: scrape, clean with grill brick, and re-season at end of shift. A clean flattop heats evenly — a dirty one gives you hot spots and cold spots.</li>
                <li>Floors: sweep after each rush. Full mop with degreaser at closing. Don't forget under equipment and behind the line — inspectors look there first.</li>
                <li>Dish area: run sanitizer cycle empty to verify temperature (180°F minimum). Clean the dish machine itself — spray arms, drain, interior walls.</li>
                <li>Walk-in and reach-ins: wipe shelves, check for spills, verify all containers are labeled with contents and date. FIFO — first in, first out. Rotate stock every time you put something away.</li>
                <li>Sanitizer test: verify concentration with test strips at every station. Post the acceptable range chart on the wall where staff can see it.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>🌙 Restaurant Closing Checklist</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The end-of-night procedure that sets up tomorrow's opening crew for success.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Last seating: stop taking new tables at the posted time. Let remaining guests finish without rushing, but don't seat new walk-ins after cutoff.</li>
                <li>Kitchen breakdown: clean all equipment per the sanitation checklist. Wrap and date all remaining prep. Put everything in the walk-in — nothing left on the counter overnight.</li>
                <li>Restock stations: refill napkins, to-go containers, bags, silverware rollups, and anything the opening crew needs so they're not scrambling during morning prep.</li>
                <li>Front-of-house: bus all tables, wipe down every surface, flip or stack chairs for floor cleaning. Clean condiment holders. Check under tables and booths for debris.</li>
                <li>Restrooms: full clean — not a wipe-down. Scrub toilets, mop floors, restock all supplies. The closing crew owns the restrooms, not the morning crew.</li>
                <li>POS: run end-of-day report, close out all tickets, reconcile cash drawer. Note any comps, voids, or discounts and the reason for each.</li>
                <li>Trash: all bins emptied and new liners in. Take trash to the dumpster — don't leave full bags by the back door overnight.</li>
                <li>Security: check all burners and ovens are off. Back door locked. Walk the entire building one final time. Set the alarm and lock the front door.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>🥗 Food Prep & Portioning Standards</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">Keeps food cost consistent and ensures every plate looks the same.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Pull the daily prep list from the kitchen manager. Check par levels against what's already prepped in the walk-in before making anything new.</li>
                <li>Weigh and portion proteins per the recipe spec sheet. Use a scale — eyeballing portions is how food cost creeps up 3% without anyone noticing.</li>
                <li>Date and label everything that goes into storage. Item name, prep date, use-by date. No exceptions, no shortcuts. Unlabeled food gets tossed.</li>
                <li>Sauces and dressings: follow the recipe card exactly. Taste for seasoning but don't freelance. Consistency means a regular gets the same dish every visit.</li>
                <li>Produce prep: wash all produce in the designated sink. Cut to spec — dice means dice, julienne means julienne. Inconsistent cuts cook unevenly and look sloppy on the plate.</li>
                <li>Store everything at the correct temperature immediately. Hot foods above 140°F, cold foods below 40°F. The danger zone isn't a suggestion — it's where you get people sick.</li>
            </ol>

        </div>

        <h2>Tips for Restaurant SOPs That Actually Get Used</h2>
        <p>The worst thing you can do is write a 30-page operations manual and hand it to your staff on day one. Nobody reads it, and it sits in the office gathering dust. Instead, create separate checklists for each specific task — opening, closing, cleaning, prep — and make them available where the work happens.</p>
        <p>Write your procedures the way you'd explain things to a new hire on their first day. Skip the corporate language. "Verify that all perishable items are stored at appropriate temperatures" means nothing to a 19-year-old line cook. "Check the walk-in thermometer — if it's above 40°F, tell the manager immediately" is what they need.</p>
        <p>Put your checklists on your staff's phones. A laminated sheet on the wall works until someone spills marinara on it. WithoutMe gives your team a link they open on their phone — they check off steps as they go, and you can see it's getting done right.</p>

        <h2>Other Procedures Worth Documenting</h2>
        <p>Beyond daily operations, most restaurants benefit from SOPs for: handling customer complaints and comps, new server training and menu knowledge, allergy and dietary restriction protocols, inventory counts and ordering, cash handling and tip-out procedures, and health inspection preparation. Each one removes a judgment call your staff would otherwise have to make on their own.</p>
