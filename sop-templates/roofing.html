        <h2>Why Roofing Companies Need Written Procedures</h2>
        <p>A roof leak six months after installation is one of the most expensive mistakes in the trades. It's almost never because your crew doesn't know how to roof — it's because they skipped a step. Missed flashing around a pipe boot, wrong nail placement in a valley, ice-and-water shield that didn't get extended far enough. Written checklists catch these before they become callbacks.</p>
        <p>These templates cover the core procedures most roofing companies need. Customize them for the materials you use, your local code requirements, and how your shop runs, then share them with your crews so every job gets done the same way.</p>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>🔍 Pre-Job Roof Inspection</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The inspection checklist before starting any roof replacement or repair job.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Walk the roof systematically — start at one corner and work in rows. Don't just look at the obvious problem area. Check the entire surface for damage you'll need to address.</li>
                <li>Check shingle condition: curling, cracking, missing granules, lifted tabs, missing shingles. Note the locations — photograph anything significant for the customer file.</li>
                <li>Inspect all flashings — pipe boots, chimney flashing, wall flashing, valley metal, drip edge. Flashing failures cause more leaks than shingle failures. Document what needs replacing versus what can stay.</li>
                <li>Check ridge caps and hip caps. Look for cracking, lifting, or missing pieces. These are high-wind failure points and commonly overlooked.</li>
                <li>Examine valleys closely. Look for wear patterns, exposed underlayment, debris buildup, or improper overlap from the last roof. Valleys handle more water than any other part of the roof.</li>
                <li>Inspect gutters and downspouts for damage, sagging, or detachment. Note if gutters need to come off during the job and whether they'll need to be replaced.</li>
                <li>Check the decking from inside the attic if accessible. Look for water stains, daylight showing through, soft spots, mold, or inadequate ventilation. Deck condition determines whether you're doing a simple re-roof or replacing plywood.</li>
                <li>Measure the roof and calculate material needs. Count penetrations, measure valleys and ridges, note the pitch. Order materials with 10-15% waste factor depending on complexity.</li>
                <li>Document everything with photos. Review findings with the homeowner, explain what's needed, and get written approval on the scope before scheduling the crew.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>⚠️ Job Site Setup & Safety</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The safety and setup procedure every crew follows before anyone gets on the roof.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Park the dumpster as close to the house as possible without damaging the driveway or yard. Position it where debris from the roof can be thrown or chuted directly in.</li>
                <li>Protect the property: lay tarps over landscaping, HVAC units, outdoor furniture, and any vehicles near the house. Roofing debris and nails will destroy anything not covered.</li>
                <li>Set up ladders on firm, level ground. Extend at least 3 feet above the eave line. Secure the top to the fascia or gutter with a stabilizer. If the ground is soft, use a ladder leveler or plywood base.</li>
                <li>Every person on the roof wears a harness connected to a roof anchor. No exceptions, regardless of pitch. Set anchors before anyone walks the deck. Verify each person's harness fit and connection before they leave the ladder.</li>
                <li>Identify power lines near the roof. If any overhead lines are within 10 feet of the work area, call the utility company before starting. Aluminum ladders and metal flashing near power lines kill people.</li>
                <li>Establish a drop zone and keep it clear. Use caution tape or cones on the ground around the perimeter. No one walks under the roof edge while tear-off or debris removal is happening.</li>
                <li>Verify all tools and materials are staged and accessible. Nail guns tested, compressor running, shingles staged on the roof or ready to be loaded. Minimize trips up and down the ladder.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>🔨 Tear-Off & Deck Preparation</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The procedure for removing old roofing and preparing the deck for new materials.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Start tear-off at the peak, working downhill. Use roofing shovels to get under the shingles and pry them up in sections. Work in rows across the roof.</li>
                <li>Remove all old shingles, underlayment, and flashing. Don't leave old material under new. Pull all nails that don't come up with the shingles — a nail left in the deck is a bump under the new roof.</li>
                <li>Throw debris directly into the dumpster as you go. Don't let it pile up on the roof or in the yard. Keep the work area clean throughout the tear-off — loose debris on the deck is a slip hazard.</li>
                <li>Inspect every square foot of decking once it's exposed. Walk the deck and feel for soft spots. Mark any damaged plywood or OSB that needs replacing.</li>
                <li>Replace damaged decking with matching thickness material. Nail replacement sheets to rafters with ring-shank nails. Make sure edges are supported and joints are staggered from the old layout.</li>
                <li>Sweep the entire deck clean. Remove every nail, staple, and piece of debris. Run a magnetic nail sweeper across the deck surface. The deck must be smooth, clean, and solid before any new material goes down.</li>
                <li>Install drip edge along the eaves first, then ice-and-water shield in required areas — at minimum along the eaves to 24 inches past the interior wall line, in all valleys, and around penetrations. Check your local code for specific requirements.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>✅ Final Inspection & Cleanup</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The walkthrough and cleanup procedure before calling the job complete.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Inspect the entire roof from the surface. Check every shingle course for alignment, proper nail placement, and full adhesion. Look at the roof from different angles — uneven courses are visible from the ground and the customer will notice.</li>
                <li>Verify all flashings are properly sealed — pipe boots, chimney, wall junctions, valleys. Check sealant coverage. This is where leaks happen, so check twice.</li>
                <li>Inspect ridge cap and hip caps for proper overlap and nailing. These are the most visible parts of the roof from the street.</li>
                <li>Check gutters are reattached securely and clear of debris. Run water through them to verify they drain properly. Replace any gutter sections damaged during the job.</li>
                <li>Ground cleanup: walk the entire perimeter of the house with a magnetic nail sweeper. Go over the yard, driveway, walkways, and street. Run the sweeper at least three passes — nails in tires are the fastest way to a bad review.</li>
                <li>Remove all tarps and protective coverings. Check that landscaping, siding, windows, and HVAC equipment are undamaged. If anything got hit, photograph it and report it immediately — don't hope the homeowner won't notice.</li>
                <li>Walk through with the homeowner. Show them the completed roof, explain the warranty, and point out any areas they should monitor. Answer their questions. Get written sign-off that the job is complete and clean.</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Roofing Checklists That Actually Get Used</h2>
        <p>Your experienced guys know how to roof. What checklists do is catch the steps that get skipped when crews are rushing to finish before weather hits or trying to squeeze in an extra job. The safety setup, the nail sweeper passes, the flashing inspection — those are the steps that disappear under pressure unless they're on a list getting checked off.</p>
        <p>Break procedures into phases that match how the job actually flows. A tear-off checklist, an install checklist, and a cleanup checklist work better than one massive document. Your crew can pull up the phase they're on and check off steps as they go.</p>
        <p>Keep the language practical. "Ensure proper flashing integration at wall-to-roof transitions" means nothing to a second-year roofer. "Step flash every course — 4-inch overlap minimum, caulk the top edge, counter-flash over it" is something they can actually follow.</p>
        <p>WithoutMe runs in any browser — your crew pulls up checklists on their phone right on the job site. No app to install, no login to remember. Share a link and they follow it.</p>

        <h2>Other Procedures Worth Documenting</h2>
        <p>Other things worth putting on paper: material ordering and staging, emergency tarp and leak response, equipment maintenance (nail guns, compressors, ladders), new hire safety training, insurance claim documentation process, customer communication at each project phase, and end-of-day tool inventory. Each one reduces the questions your crew brings to you and keeps jobs running when you're on a different site.</p>
