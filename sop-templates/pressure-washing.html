        <p>Step-by-step procedures your crew follows on every job — so surfaces get clean without damage and every job looks the same.</p>

        <h2>Why Pressure Washing Businesses Need Written Checklists</h2>
        <p>Pressure washing looks simple until someone puts 3,000 PSI on vinyl siding and blows water behind it, or etches tiger stripes into a concrete driveway. The difference between a great result and expensive damage comes down to knowing the right pressure, nozzle, chemical, and technique for each surface. Written checklists keep your crew doing it right on every job, not guessing.</p>
        <p>These procedures cover the services most pressure washing businesses offer. They're written for real wash crews doing real field work — not equipment manuals.</p>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>🏠 House Wash (Soft Wash) Procedure</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The standard soft wash procedure for vinyl, wood, stucco, and painted exterior surfaces.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Walk the property with the customer before starting. Note any existing damage, areas of concern, and surfaces they want avoided. Photograph anything questionable — protect yourself from blame for pre-existing issues.</li>
                <li>Close all windows and doors. Cover or move anything that shouldn't get wet: outdoor furniture cushions, potted plants near the house, electrical outlets, and light fixtures. Pre-wet all plants and landscaping within 10 feet of the house — the rinse water protects them from chemical contact.</li>
                <li>Mix your soft wash solution to the correct dilution for the surface type. Vinyl siding and painted surfaces: standard house wash mix. Wood: reduced strength. Stucco: test a small area first — some stucco reacts badly to sodium hypochlorite.</li>
                <li>Apply the solution from bottom to top to prevent streaking. Work in manageable sections — don't apply to the entire house at once. Chemical drying on the surface before rinse causes streaks that are harder to remove than the original dirt.</li>
                <li>Let the solution dwell for the appropriate time — typically 5-10 minutes. Watch for the dirt and algae breaking down. If stubborn spots remain, reapply to those areas. Don't increase pressure as a substitute for proper chemical dwell time.</li>
                <li>Rinse from top to bottom with low pressure — a soft wash means soft rinse. Never use a high-pressure tip on siding. Overlap your rinse pattern so you don't leave lines. Rinse windows, doors, and trim thoroughly.</li>
                <li>Rinse all landscaping and hard surfaces that received chemical overspray. Walk the entire perimeter and check your work — look for missed spots, streaks, and any areas that need a second pass. Final rinse of plants.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

            <h3>🅿️ Concrete & Driveway Cleaning</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The procedure for cleaning driveways, sidewalks, patios, and other flatwork without leaving marks.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Pre-treat oil stains and heavy grease spots with a degreaser. Apply directly, scrub with a stiff brush, and let it dwell before you start pressure washing. Pre-treatment makes a bigger difference on concrete than any amount of pressure.</li>
                <li>Apply a sodium hypochlorite pre-treat to the entire surface for organic growth (algae, mold, mildew). Let it dwell 5-10 minutes. You'll see the green and black start to lighten — that means it's working.</li>
                <li>Use a surface cleaner attachment for all flatwork — never a wand alone on large concrete areas. A wand leaves tiger stripes (visible line marks). A surface cleaner gives an even, consistent clean.</li>
                <li>Work in straight, overlapping passes. Move at a consistent speed — going too fast leaves dirty strips, going too slow can etch. Overlap each pass by about 2 inches so you don't leave lines between passes.</li>
                <li>Edges and borders: switch to a wand with a 25-degree tip for edges where the surface cleaner can't reach — along curbs, garage door seals, expansion joints, and against the house foundation. Match the cleaning level of the surface cleaner area.</li>
                <li>Post-treat with sodium hypochlorite after pressure washing to kill any remaining organic growth at the root. This extends the clean — without post-treatment, algae grows back in months instead of a year.</li>
                <li>Rinse all adjacent surfaces — landscaping, walls, vehicles — that received any overspray. Walk the entire driveway and check from multiple angles. Missed spots and lines are most visible when the concrete starts drying.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

            <h3>🔧 Equipment Maintenance & End-of-Day</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The daily maintenance routine that keeps your equipment running and prevents expensive breakdowns.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>After every job: flush clean water through the chemical lines for at least 2 minutes. Chemical residue corrodes pumps, fittings, and nozzles if left sitting. This is the single most important equipment maintenance habit.</li>
                <li>Inspect the high-pressure hose for cuts, bulges, kinks, or worn spots. A hose failure under pressure is a serious safety hazard. Replace hoses at the first sign of damage — don't tape them.</li>
                <li>Check and clean all nozzle tips. Remove any debris. Worn nozzles lose their spray pattern and reduce cleaning effectiveness. Carry spares and swap them when the pattern starts to fan unevenly.</li>
                <li>Check the engine oil level on gas-powered units. Top off as needed. Check fuel level and fill at the end of the day, not the start — condensation forms in half-empty tanks sitting overnight.</li>
                <li>Drain all water from the pump and hoses if temperatures will drop below freezing. Frozen water cracks pump heads and fittings. Use pump antifreeze if you won't be running the equipment for extended cold periods.</li>
                <li>Coil hoses properly — no kinks, no sharp bends. Store surface cleaner attachments off the ground. Secure all equipment in the trailer for transit. Loose equipment banging around in transit damages it and creates road hazards.</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Pressure Washing Checklists That Actually Get Used</h2>
        <p>Your crews are outside, on ladders, holding spray guns, and often wearing gloves. Checklists need to be dead simple and phone-friendly. One checklist per surface type — house wash, concrete, roof, wood deck — each one standalone. When a crew pulls up to a driveway job, they need the concrete checklist, not a 15-page operations manual.</p>
        <p>Put the critical numbers right in the checklist. "Use appropriate pressure" means nothing to a new hire. "Vinyl siding: 500-800 PSI max, 25-degree tip, soft wash only" tells them exactly what to do. Chemical dilution ratios, dwell times, and PSI limits are the steps that prevent damage — spell them out.</p>
        <p>Build your checklists around the mistakes that cost money. Every pressure washing company has a "that time we etched the driveway" or "that time we killed the landscaping" story. Those are the procedures to document in detail. Preventing one damage claim pays for the time it took to write the checklist.</p>

        <h2>Other Procedures Worth Documenting</h2>
        <p>Beyond the core wash procedures, most pressure washing businesses benefit from documenting: roof washing (separate technique and chemicals), wood deck and fence restoration, commercial building washing, job quoting and estimating, customer walkthrough and before/after photos, and chemical handling safety. Each one keeps your crew consistent and your business protected.</p>
