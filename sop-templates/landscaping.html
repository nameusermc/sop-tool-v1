        <p>Every property, every crew, same quality — even when you're not riding with them.</p>

        <h2>Why Landscaping Companies Need SOPs</h2>
        <p>Landscaping is a volume business. Your crews are hitting 8 to 15 properties a day, and the difference between a good company and a great one is whether every single lawn looks the same when they leave — not just the ones you personally checked. When you're running multiple crews across town, you can't ride along on every route.</p>
        <p>SOPs solve the consistency problem. They give every crew lead the same checklist of what to do, in what order, at every property. They also massively speed up training for seasonal hires — instead of a week of ride-alongs, a new crew member can reference the procedure on their phone while they work. The result: fewer missed tasks, fewer client complaints, and fewer calls asking you what to do.</p>

        <h2>Essential Landscaping SOP Templates</h2>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>🏡 Weekly Lawn Maintenance Visit</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The standard checklist for every residential maintenance visit.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Arrive on schedule. Check the property notes for any client-specific instructions (skip backyard, dog is loose on Tuesdays, gate code, etc.).</li>
                <li>Walk the property before starting. Look for obstacles, new objects, pet waste, sprinkler heads, or anything the mower could hit or damage.</li>
                <li>Mow the lawn at the height set for this property and season. Alternate mowing direction from the previous visit to prevent ruts and grain.</li>
                <li>String trim all edges — along sidewalks, driveways, fence lines, beds, and around trees, mailboxes, and posts. Clean lines make the difference.</li>
                <li>Edge hard surfaces (sidewalks, driveways) with a blade edger. Maintain the existing edge line — don't widen it.</li>
                <li>Blow all clippings off sidewalks, driveways, patios, and beds. Blow toward the lawn, not into the street or onto the neighbor's property.</li>
                <li>Quick visual check of beds and shrubs — pull any obvious weeds that take less than a minute. Note anything that needs attention for the next service visit.</li>
                <li>Final walkthrough from the street. Look at the property the way the homeowner will see it when they pull into the driveway. Fix anything that stands out.</li>
                <li>Take a photo if the property is a new client (first 4 visits) or if you noticed and fixed anything unusual. Send to the office.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>🍂 Spring / Fall Cleanup Procedure</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">Seasonal cleanup workflow for residential properties.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Arrive with full cleanup equipment: backpack blowers, rakes, tarp, debris bags, bed edger, and pruners.</li>
                <li>Blow out all beds, under shrubs, along fence lines, and off hard surfaces. Work from the back of the property toward the front, pushing debris to collection points.</li>
                <li>Rake and collect all leaf and debris piles. Tarp large volumes to the truck or trailer. Bag what won't fit.</li>
                <li>Cut back dead perennials and ornamental grasses (spring). Remove any frost-damaged or dead branches from shrubs.</li>
                <li>Re-edge all bed lines with a blade edger. Clean, defined edges are the single biggest visual impact of a cleanup.</li>
                <li>Apply pre-emergent to beds if included in the service (spring). Spread fresh mulch if scheduled — 2 to 3 inches, pulled back 2 inches from tree trunks and plant stems.</li>
                <li>Final blow of all hard surfaces. Walk the entire property from the curb — nothing should be left behind.</li>
                <li>Note any irrigation heads that need adjustment, dead plants that should be replaced, or areas where turf is thin and needs overseeding. Report to the office for client follow-up.</li>
            </ol>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>🚜 Daily Equipment Inspection</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">Pre-route equipment check every crew lead performs before leaving the shop.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Check mower blades — sharp blades cut clean, dull blades tear grass and leave brown tips. Swap or sharpen if needed. Note hours on each mower.</li>
                <li>Check mower oil level and air filter. Top off fuel. Look under the deck for built-up clippings and scrape clean if needed.</li>
                <li>Inspect trimmer line — reload if low. Check that the guard is in place. Verify the trimmer starts on the first or second pull.</li>
                <li>Test backpack blowers. Confirm full power and no unusual sounds. Check air filter.</li>
                <li>Inspect edger blade — replace if worn past the indicator mark. Verify belt tension.</li>
                <li>Check trailer tires, lights, and hitch pin. Confirm all equipment is strapped down securely.</li>
                <li>Verify the truck has the route sheet, gate codes, and any special instructions for today's properties.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>🌱 Mulch and Bed Maintenance</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">Standard procedure for mulch installation and bed maintenance visits.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Calculate mulch needed before delivery: measure bed square footage, divide by 108 for cubic yards at 3 inches deep. Order 10% extra for irregularly shaped beds.</li>
                <li>Prep all beds before mulch arrives: pull weeds, remove old mulch that's decomposed to soil, re-edge all bed lines.</li>
                <li>Apply pre-emergent weed barrier if included in the service. Follow label rates exactly — too much can damage desirable plants.</li>
                <li>Wheelbarrow mulch to each bed. Dump in small piles and spread with a rake. Work from the back of the bed toward the front to avoid stepping in finished areas.</li>
                <li>Maintain 2 to 3 inches of depth throughout. Pull mulch 2 inches away from tree trunks and plant stems — mulch volcanoes damage bark and invite rot.</li>
                <li>Blow all stray mulch off sidewalks, driveways, and lawn areas. Clean edges make the job look professional.</li>
                <li>Final walkthrough: check depth consistency, clean edges, no mulch on hard surfaces, no mulch touching trunks.</li>
            </ol>

        </div>

        <h2>Getting Your Crews to Follow SOPs</h2>
        <p>Landscaping crews move fast and work outdoors — they're not going to flip through a binder between properties. SOPs need to be on their phone, fast to scan, and organized by task type. Keep steps short. "Mow, trim, edge, blow" is four steps, not one.</p>
        <p>Start with your weekly maintenance visit SOP — it's the procedure your crews run most often, and it's where inconsistency causes the most client complaints. Get that dialed in before adding seasonal cleanup, hardscaping, or planting procedures.</p>
        <p>WithoutMe works on any phone browser. Share a link with your crew leads and they can pull up the procedure between stops. No app to download, no account needed. A seasonal hire on their first day can follow the same checklist your best crew uses.</p>

        <h2>Other Landscaping Procedures Worth Documenting</h2>
        <p>Beyond the core templates, most landscaping companies benefit from SOPs for: irrigation system startup and winterization, shrub and hedge trimming standards, new property onboarding walkthrough, snow removal procedures (if applicable), herbicide and fertilizer application safety, new hire training checklist, and end-of-season equipment storage. Each one reduces the questions your crew brings to you.</p>
