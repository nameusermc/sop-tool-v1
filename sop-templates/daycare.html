        <p>Step-by-step procedures your childcare staff can follow every day — routines, safety, sanitizing, documentation — without calling you.</p>

    <div class="tp-container">
        <h2>Why Daycare Centers Need Written Procedures</h2>
        <p>Childcare is one of the most procedure-intensive businesses there is. Every state has licensing requirements around ratios, sanitation, documentation, and emergency response. When your staff follows the same steps every day, you stay compliant and parents trust that their kids are getting consistent care — whether you're in the building or not.</p>
        <p>These templates cover the daily procedures most daycare centers need. Customize them for your center's specific routines, licensing requirements, and age groups, then share them with your staff so everyone is on the same page.</p>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>🌅 Daily Opening Procedure</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">What staff does every morning before the first child arrives to ensure the center is safe and ready.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Arrive 30 minutes before opening. Unlock the building and disarm the security system. Do a full walkthrough of every room before turning on lights and music.</li>
                <li>Check all rooms for hazards — anything on the floor that shouldn't be, furniture out of place, broken toys, anything that changed overnight. Remove or fix before children arrive.</li>
                <li>Verify indoor temperature is comfortable (68-72°F). Adjust thermostats if needed. In summer, check that AC is running. In winter, confirm heat is working in all rooms.</li>
                <li>Sanitize all high-touch surfaces — door handles, light switches, tables, chairs, cubbies, and bathroom fixtures. Use approved sanitizing solution at the correct dilution.</li>
                <li>Set up each classroom for the day. Check the daily schedule posted in the room. Lay out activity materials for the first activity. Make sure art supplies, books, and sensory bins are ready.</li>
                <li>Check diaper stations — stocked with diapers, wipes, gloves, and plastic bags. Changing pad clean and sanitized. Hand sanitizer accessible.</li>
                <li>Verify first aid kit in each room is stocked. Check that emergency binder is present with current contact sheets, allergy lists, and medication authorizations.</li>
                <li>Prepare sign-in sheets at the front entrance. Check the day's schedule for any special notes — field trips, visitors, children out sick, allergy alerts.</li>
                <li>Open doors at the posted time. Greet each family by name. The day starts calm and organized.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>🚗 Drop-Off & Pick-Up Verification</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The procedure that ensures every child is properly signed in and released only to authorized individuals.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Every child must be signed in by their parent or authorized adult. Sign-in includes: child's name, time of arrival, parent's signature, and any notes (medication, early pick-up, mood/health concerns).</li>
                <li>Check each child visually during drop-off. Note anything unusual — bruises, rashes, signs of illness, or emotional distress. Document and report per your state's requirements.</li>
                <li>Confirm any medications brought in are in original packaging, labeled with the child's name, and accompanied by a signed medication authorization form. Store in the locked medication cabinet.</li>
                <li>Update your classroom headcount immediately after each arrival. Verify your count matches your sign-in sheet at 9:00 AM and again after any transition (outdoor time, lunch, nap).</li>
                <li>At pick-up: verify the person collecting the child is on the authorized pick-up list. If you don't recognize them, check their ID against the authorization form. No exceptions, even if the child seems to know them.</li>
                <li>Never release a child to someone not on the list without verbal confirmation from the parent — a phone call, not a text. Document the authorization with the parent's name, time, and who they authorized.</li>
                <li>Parent signs out with time of departure. Do a final headcount after each pick-up. At closing, your sign-out count must match your sign-in count with zero children unaccounted for.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>🧼 Cleaning & Sanitizing Schedule</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The daily, weekly, and as-needed sanitizing tasks that keep your center compliant and kids healthy.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Tables must be sanitized before and after every meal and snack. Spray with approved sanitizer, let sit for the required contact time (usually 2 minutes), then wipe dry. Don't shortcut the contact time.</li>
                <li>Toys that go in mouths get sanitized after each use. Hard toys go in the sanitizing bin. Soft toys that can't be easily sanitized are removed from infant and toddler rooms.</li>
                <li>Diaper changing area gets sanitized after every single diaper change. Spray the pad, sides, and any surface you touched. Fresh paper liner for each child. Gloves changed between children.</li>
                <li>Bathroom surfaces — toilets, sinks, faucets, step stools — cleaned after each group bathroom visit and at minimum three times daily. More often for toddler rooms in potty training.</li>
                <li>Floors swept or vacuumed after meals, after art projects, and at end of day. Mopped daily. Spot-clean spills immediately — a wet floor is a slip hazard.</li>
                <li>Nap mats and cot sheets laundered weekly minimum, immediately if soiled. Each child uses the same mat daily — label them. Mats stored so sleeping surfaces don't touch each other.</li>
                <li>Kitchen area cleaned after each meal prep. Counters sanitized, dishes washed, food stored properly, trash taken out. Refrigerator temperature logged daily — must be at or below 40°F.</li>
                <li>Weekly deep clean: wash all classroom toys in sanitizing solution, wipe down shelves and cubbies, launder dress-up clothes and cloth items, clean windows at child height, sanitize doorknobs throughout the building.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>🚨 Incident & Injury Response</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">What to do when a child gets hurt — from minor bumps to situations that need medical attention.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Comfort the child first. Stay calm — children take their cue from your reaction. Assess the injury while keeping the child (and the other children) calm.</li>
                <li>For minor injuries (small scrapes, bumps, bruises): clean the wound if needed, apply ice or a bandage, comfort the child, and document it. These happen daily — handle them calmly and consistently.</li>
                <li>For anything beyond minor: head injuries, deep cuts, possible sprains, allergic reactions — call the director or lead teacher immediately. Do not move the child if there's any chance of a neck or back injury.</li>
                <li>Call 911 for any emergency: difficulty breathing, unconsciousness, severe bleeding, seizure, severe allergic reaction. Stay on the line. Have another staff member meet the ambulance at the door.</li>
                <li>Complete an incident report within 1 hour of the event. Include: child's name, date, time, location, what happened, what you observed, what first aid was given, and who was notified.</li>
                <li>Notify the parent. For minor injuries, inform at pick-up and provide the written incident report. For anything significant, call the parent immediately — don't wait until pick-up.</li>
                <li>Both the parent and a staff witness sign the incident report. File the original in the child's folder. Give a copy to the parent. Report to your licensing agency if the incident meets your state's mandatory reporting threshold.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Build your daycare procedures in minutes</h3>
            <p>Customize these checklists for your center, share them with every teacher via a link on their phone, and keep care consistent all day.</p>
            <a href="/" class="tp-cta-btn">Start building — it's free</a>
            <p class="tp-cta-note">No signup required. No credit card. Just start.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Tips for Daycare Checklists That Actually Get Used</h2>
        <p>Your teachers are managing rooms full of children — they don't have time to read a manual. Checklists need to be short, specific, and available on their phone or posted in the room where they'll use them. One procedure per task, not a 20-page employee handbook.</p>
        <p>Write steps the way you'd explain them to a new hire on their first day. "Sanitize tables before lunch" is vague. "Spray tables with the blue sanitizer, wait 2 minutes, wipe dry with a clean cloth" is a step someone can actually follow. The more specific you are, the fewer questions you get.</p>
        <p>Update your checklists when licensing requirements change. Outdated procedures are worse than no procedures because staff thinks they're compliant when they're not. Keep them current and your next licensing inspection goes smoothly.</p>
        <p>WithoutMe runs in any browser — your staff clicks a link, sees the procedure, and follows it step by step. No app to install, no login to remember. Post the link in each classroom or bookmark it on the classroom tablet.</p>

        <h2>Other Procedures Worth Documenting</h2>
        <p>Beyond daily routines, most daycare centers benefit from documenting: fire drill and emergency evacuation, severe weather shelter procedure, new child enrollment and first-day process, parent communication guidelines, staff opening and closing duties, field trip planning and supervision ratios, allergy management and epi-pen administration, and nap time supervision requirements. Each one keeps your center running smoothly when you're not in the building.</p>
