        <h2>Why Detailing Businesses Need Written Checklists</h2>
        <p>Detailing is detail work — that's the whole point. But when you're not personally working on every car, it's easy for steps to get rushed or skipped. A quick interior becomes "I vacuumed and wiped the dash." The tire dressing gets forgotten. The door jambs don't get touched. Written checklists mean every car gets every step, every time, no matter who's working on it.</p>
        <p>These procedures cover the core services most detailing businesses offer. Use them as a starting point and adjust for how your shop works.</p>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>🚿 Exterior Wash & Decontamination</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The full exterior wash procedure from pre-rinse to drying — the foundation of every detail.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Pre-rinse the entire vehicle top to bottom with a pressure washer. Knock off loose dirt and debris before anything touches the paint. Never start with a mitt on a dry, dirty car.</li>
                <li>Apply foam cannon soap and let it dwell for 2-3 minutes. The foam does the heavy lifting — it loosens and encapsulates dirt so your wash mitt doesn't grind it into the paint.</li>
                <li>Two-bucket wash: one bucket with soap solution, one with clean rinse water and a grit guard. Wash top to bottom in straight lines — never circles. Rinse the mitt in the clean bucket before reloading with soap.</li>
                <li>Wheels and tires: use a dedicated wheel brush and wheel-safe cleaner. Never use your paint mitt on wheels — brake dust is abrasive and will contaminate your mitt. Clean lug nut holes, behind spokes, and tire sidewalls.</li>
                <li>Rinse the entire vehicle thoroughly. Remove all soap — any residue left behind will show up after drying, especially on dark paint.</li>
                <li>Clay bar treatment (if included in service): spray clay lubricant on one panel at a time, glide the clay bar in straight lines. Feel the surface — when it goes from rough to glass-smooth, that panel is done. Fold and re-knead the clay frequently.</li>
                <li>Final rinse with filtered water if available. Dry immediately with clean microfiber drying towels — pat and drag technique, not circular rubbing. Air blower for crevices, mirrors, and emblems where water hides.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>🪑 Interior Deep Clean</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The complete interior procedure that customers actually notice and talk about.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Remove all floor mats. Shake out loose debris, then scrub with all-purpose cleaner and a brush. Set aside to dry while you work on the rest of the interior.</li>
                <li>Vacuum everything: seats, carpets, trunk, between and under seats, door pockets, center console, cup holders. Use crevice tools for tight spots. If you can see it, vacuum it.</li>
                <li>Leather seats: apply leather cleaner with a soft brush, agitate gently in small sections, wipe clean with a microfiber. Follow with leather conditioner — this prevents cracking and keeps the leather supple.</li>
                <li>Fabric seats: spray upholstery cleaner, agitate with a brush, extract with a hot water extractor. Work in sections and don't oversaturate — seats that stay wet too long develop mildew.</li>
                <li>Dashboard, console, and trim: wipe all surfaces with interior detailer and a microfiber. Use detailing brushes for air vents, buttons, knobs, and seams where dust collects. No heavy silicone dressings — they attract dust and look greasy.</li>
                <li>Glass: clean all interior glass with automotive glass cleaner and a clean microfiber. Wipe in one direction, then buff in the perpendicular direction. Check from the driver's seat angle — streaks show up at eye level in direct sunlight.</li>
                <li>Replace floor mats. Apply a light interior fragrance if the customer requested it — never without asking. Final walkthrough: sit in every seat position and look around. Would you hand this car back to a customer?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>✨ Paint Correction & Polish</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The multi-step paint correction process for swirl removal and gloss restoration.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Inspect the paint under proper lighting — use a detailing inspection light or LED panel. Mark problem areas with painter's tape. You can't correct what you can't see.</li>
                <li>Tape off trim, rubber, and any areas you don't want polish residue on. Plastic trim absorbs polish and turns white — prevention is easier than correction.</li>
                <li>Start with a test spot in an inconspicuous area. Try the least aggressive combination first — medium pad with finishing polish. Only step up to a cutting compound if needed.</li>
                <li>Work one panel at a time. Apply 3-4 pea-sized dots of polish to the pad. Spread at low speed, then work at medium speed in overlapping passes. Keep the machine moving — dwelling in one spot generates heat and can burn through clear coat.</li>
                <li>Wipe off residue with a clean microfiber and inspect under the light. Compare the corrected area to the uncorrected area. Repeat the pass if swirls remain. Move to the next panel only when you're satisfied.</li>
                <li>After all panels are corrected, do a final wipe-down with an IPA (isopropyl alcohol) solution to remove polish oils. This reveals the true condition of the paint — oils can temporarily fill swirls and hide them.</li>
                <li>Apply sealant or wax to protect the corrected paint. Document with before/after photos for the customer and your portfolio.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>✅ Quality Inspection Before Customer Pickup</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The final check before any vehicle leaves your shop — catches mistakes before the customer does.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Walk around the entire vehicle slowly. Check every panel for water spots, missed polish residue, or fingerprints. Check under door handles — polish residue hides there.</li>
                <li>Open all four doors. Check door jambs are clean. Check sill plates. Check the inside edges of the doors where overspray and dirt collect.</li>
                <li>Sit in the driver's seat. Look at the windshield at eye level — any streaks? Check the rearview mirror for smudges. Run your eyes across the dash and console.</li>
                <li>Check the trunk: vacuumed, no tools or trash left behind, trunk jamb wiped clean.</li>
                <li>Tires and wheels: dressing applied evenly to all four tires (no sling on the paint), wheels clean including behind the spokes, lug nuts free of polish residue.</li>
                <li>Final items: mirrors folded back to normal position, seats and mirrors in the same position as when the customer dropped off, radio and climate left as-is, no personal items misplaced.</li>
                <li>Take completion photos. Stage the car in a clean area if possible — how it looks when the customer arrives is the impression they keep.</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Detailing Checklists That Actually Get Used</h2>
        <p>Detailers are hands-on people. They're not going to read a long document between cars. Your checklists need to be short, specific, and organized by service level. A "basic wash" checklist, an "interior detail" checklist, a "paint correction" checklist — each one standalone, each one pullable on a phone.</p>
        <p>Include the "why" for critical steps. "Never use your paint mitt on wheels" doesn't stick unless they understand that brake dust scratches paint. When your team understands the reason behind a step, they're more likely to follow it consistently.</p>
        <p>Build your checklists around the mistakes that cost you money — redos, complaints, and damage claims. If your most common callback is "they missed the door jambs," make door jambs a specific checklist item, not part of a vague "wipe down exterior" step.</p>

        <h2>Other Procedures Worth Documenting</h2>
        <p>Beyond vehicle procedures, most detailing businesses benefit from documenting: vehicle intake and condition documentation, customer communication and quoting, product mixing and dilution ratios, equipment maintenance and cleaning, supply ordering and inventory management, and new employee training progression. Each one reduces inconsistency and the questions your team brings to you.</p>
