        <h1>Painting Company Checklists & Procedure Templates</h1>
        <p>Step-by-step procedures your painting crew can follow on every job — prep, paint, inspect, clean up — without calling you.</p>
    </section>

    <div class="tp-container">
        <h2>Why Painting Companies Need Written Procedures</h2>
        <p>The difference between a callback and a clean job is almost always prep work. When your crew skips steps — doesn't sand properly, misses a crack, cuts corners on masking — you end up back on that job a week later fixing it for free. Written checklists make sure every step happens on every job, even when you're not there watching.</p>
        <p>These templates cover the core procedures most painting companies need. Customize them for how your shop works, share them with your crew, and stop answering the same questions on every job.</p>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>🔨 Surface Preparation — Interior Walls</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The prep procedure that prevents 90% of paint failures and callbacks.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Walk the room and inspect every wall surface. Mark problem areas with blue painter's tape — cracks, nail pops, peeling paint, water stains, holes.</li>
                <li>Move furniture to the center of the room and cover with plastic drop cloths. Lay canvas drop cloths on the floor along every wall. Tape drop cloths at baseboards so they don't shift.</li>
                <li>Remove all outlet covers, switch plates, and light fixture covers. Put them in a labeled bag so nothing gets lost or mixed up between rooms.</li>
                <li>Clean walls with a damp rag to remove dust, cobwebs, and grease. Kitchen walls near the stove need a degreaser. Let walls dry completely before any patching.</li>
                <li>Scrape any peeling or flaking paint with a 5-in-1 tool. Feather the edges so the transition between bare surface and old paint is smooth, not a hard ridge.</li>
                <li>Fill nail holes and small cracks with lightweight spackle. For anything deeper than 1/8 inch, use setting-type joint compound and let it cure fully before sanding.</li>
                <li>Sand all patched areas smooth with 120-grit paper. Run your hand over each patch — if you can feel the edge, sand more. Wipe sanding dust with a damp rag.</li>
                <li>Caulk all gaps where trim meets wall, where crown meets ceiling, and around window and door casings. Tool the caulk smooth with a wet finger. Let dry per manufacturer's time.</li>
                <li>Prime all patched areas, bare wood, and any stains. Spot-prime with the correct primer — PVA for drywall, shellac for stains, bonding primer for glossy surfaces. Full prime if the surface needs it.</li>
                <li>Mask all trim, ceiling edges, and anything that isn't getting painted. Use quality tape and press the edge firmly — cheap tape and lazy application means bleed-through.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

            <h3>🏠 Interior Room Painting — Walls and Ceiling</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The standard sequence for painting a room from ceiling to trim.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Stir paint thoroughly before starting. Box multiple cans together for color consistency — pour all cans into a 5-gallon bucket and mix, especially on larger rooms.</li>
                <li>Cut in the ceiling first if it's being painted. Work in 3-foot sections along the edges where ceiling meets wall. Complete the ceiling with a roller before moving to walls.</li>
                <li>Cut in all wall edges — ceiling line, corners, around trim, outlets, and windows. Stay 2-3 rooms ahead of the roller person so cut lines are still wet when rolled.</li>
                <li>Roll walls in a "W" pattern, working in 3x3-foot sections. Start near the ceiling and work down. Maintain a wet edge — never let a section dry before blending into the next.</li>
                <li>Apply two coats minimum. Let the first coat dry per the paint manufacturer's instructions before recoating. Check for holidays (missed spots) and thin areas between coats.</li>
                <li>Inspect the room before pulling tape. Look at walls from multiple angles and with a work light. Touch up any thin spots, roller marks, or missed areas now — not after the tape is gone.</li>
                <li>Pull tape while the final coat is still slightly tacky. Pull at a 45-degree angle, slowly. If paint bridges the tape edge, score it lightly with a utility knife first.</li>
                <li>Do final touch-ups after tape is removed. Use a small angled brush for any bleed-through spots along trim lines.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>🏗️ Exterior Painting Procedure</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The full procedure for exterior residential painting from prep through final coat.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Walk the entire exterior with the homeowner. Note and photograph any existing damage — cracked siding, rotted trim, peeling areas, caulk failures. Get written approval on what's being painted versus repaired.</li>
                <li>Pressure wash all surfaces being painted. Use appropriate pressure — lower for wood siding, higher for concrete and masonry. Let dry for 24-48 hours minimum before painting.</li>
                <li>Scrape all loose and peeling paint. Hand-scrape around windows, doors, and detail work. Power sand large flat areas if needed. Feather all edges smooth.</li>
                <li>Replace any rotted wood trim and patch damaged siding. This is repair work, not painting — if it's beyond basic patching, flag it for the customer before proceeding.</li>
                <li>Caulk all joints — where trim meets siding, around windows and doors, anywhere two materials meet. Use paintable exterior caulk rated for the temperature range in your area.</li>
                <li>Prime all bare wood, bare metal, patched areas, and stain bleed-through. Use the primer specified for the surface type. Don't skip this — exterior primer adhesion is what keeps the job looking good for years.</li>
                <li>Protect all surfaces not being painted — windows, doors, fixtures, landscaping, driveways. Use masking film for windows, drop cloths for bushes and walkways. Overspray on a customer's car or plants is an expensive mistake.</li>
                <li>Paint top to bottom — soffits and fascia first, then walls, then trim and detail work last. Two coats on all surfaces. Maintain wet edges on long runs of siding.</li>
                <li>Final walk: check every surface from 10 feet away (the distance a homeowner sees it from). Check all edges, corners, under soffits, and around fixtures. Touch up anything that doesn't look right.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>✅ Final Walkthrough & Job Cleanup</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The inspection and cleanup procedure before calling the job complete.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Do a room-by-room inspection before the customer sees anything. Check walls in natural light and with a work light. Look for holidays, drips, uneven coverage, and tape bleed.</li>
                <li>Check all trim and detail work up close. Run your eye along every edge where two colors meet — clean, straight lines. Touch up any wobbles or bleed-through.</li>
                <li>Reinstall all outlet covers, switch plates, and light fixtures you removed. Make sure they're straight and clean — no paint on the covers.</li>
                <li>Clean all paint off glass, hardware, and any surface that got accidentally hit. Use a razor scraper for glass, appropriate solvent for hardware. Check floors for drips.</li>
                <li>Move all furniture back to its original position. Remove all drop cloths, tape, and masking. Sweep or vacuum any dust and debris.</li>
                <li>Leave the remaining paint for the homeowner. Label each can with the room, color name, and sheen. They'll need it for future touch-ups.</li>
                <li>Walk through with the customer. Let them inspect at their pace. Note any concerns and address them on the spot if possible. Get sign-off that the job is complete.</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Painting Procedures That Actually Get Used</h2>
        <p>Your painters know how to paint. What they skip is the stuff that's "obvious" but easy to forget — pulling tape at the right time, checking coverage with a work light, labeling leftover cans. Those are the steps worth documenting because those are the steps that cause callbacks when they get missed.</p>
        <p>Keep each checklist focused on one phase of the job. A prep checklist, a painting checklist, and a cleanup checklist work better than one massive document. Your crew can pull up just the phase they're on and check off steps as they go.</p>
        <p>Include specific techniques where they matter. "Sand patched areas" isn't as useful as "sand with 120-grit, run your hand over it, if you feel the edge sand more." New painters especially need that level of detail to deliver the same quality your experienced guys do instinctively.</p>
        <p>WithoutMe runs in any browser — your crew clicks a link, sees the procedure, and follows it on their phone while they work. No app to install, no login to remember.</p>

        <h2>Other Procedures Worth Documenting</h2>
        <p>Beyond the core painting procedures, most companies benefit from documenting: estimating and quoting procedures, color consultation process, paint and supply ordering, spray equipment maintenance and cleaning, ladder and scaffold safety setup, new painter training checklist, and customer communication templates. Each one removes a question your crew would otherwise bring to you.</p>
