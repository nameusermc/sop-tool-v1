        <p>Cleaning checklists, equipment procedures, and opening/closing routines your staff follows every shift — so your facility stays clean and safe.</p>

        <h2>Why Gyms Need Written Checklists</h2>
        <p>Members notice two things about a gym faster than anything else: cleanliness and broken equipment. A dirty locker room or an out-of-order machine is all it takes for someone to cancel their membership. Written checklists keep your cleaning staff hitting every surface and your team catching equipment issues before members find them.</p>
        <p>These procedures cover the core operations every gym and fitness center needs documented. They cover what happens before doors open, during operating hours, and after close — the stuff that keeps members coming back.</p>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>🧹 Gym Floor Cleaning Checklist</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The hourly and daily cleaning routine that keeps the workout floor member-ready at all times.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Hourly during operating hours: walk the entire floor. Wipe down any equipment with visible sweat using gym-grade disinfectant and a clean cloth. Re-rack any weights or equipment left out by members.</li>
                <li>Spray and wipe all cardio equipment touchpoints — handles, screens, heart rate sensors, and console buttons. Use disinfectant that's effective but won't damage screens or rubber grips.</li>
                <li>Check and refill spray bottle stations and paper towel dispensers on the floor. Empty stations mean members don't wipe their equipment, which means your staff does more work.</li>
                <li>Wipe all benches, seats, and pads on weight machines. Check for tears in upholstery — torn pads trap sweat and bacteria and need to be reported for repair.</li>
                <li>Vacuum or sweep rubber flooring in the free weight area. Pick up any chalk residue if your gym allows chalk. Mop with a gym-floor-safe cleaner — no residue that makes floors slippery.</li>
                <li>Clean mirrors and any glass surfaces. Members use mirrors to check form — streaks and smudges are immediately visible and make the space feel dirty.</li>
                <li>End-of-day deep clean: wipe every piece of equipment (not just the ones that look used), mop the entire floor, dust ceiling fans and vents, and wipe all door handles, water fountain buttons, and handrails.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>🚿 Locker Room & Restroom Cleaning</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The cleaning procedure that handles the highest-traffic, highest-complaint area of any gym.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Check locker rooms every 2 hours during operating hours. This isn't optional — locker rooms deteriorate fast during peak times. Set a timer or assign specific check times.</li>
                <li>Showers: spray all walls, floors, and fixtures with disinfectant. Scrub any visible soap scum or mildew. Check drains — slow drains are the number one locker room complaint. Remove hair and debris from drain covers.</li>
                <li>Toilets and urinals: clean inside and out with toilet-specific disinfectant. Wipe the exterior, seat, and handle. Check for clogs. Refill toilet paper — don't wait until it's completely empty.</li>
                <li>Sinks and vanity area: wipe counters, sinks, and mirrors. Refill soap dispensers, paper towels, and any provided amenities (lotion, hair dryers, etc.). Empty trash cans before they overflow.</li>
                <li>Floors: mop with a disinfectant floor cleaner. Pay attention to corners and under benches where water pools. Wet floors are a slip hazard — use wet floor signs and ensure adequate drainage.</li>
                <li>Sauna/steam room (if applicable): wipe benches with appropriate cleaner, check temperature settings, ensure timer controls are working, and verify that the door closes and seals properly.</li>
                <li>End-of-day: full deep clean of everything above, plus wipe down all lockers (exterior handles and surfaces), clean benches, and disinfect any shared grooming tools or areas.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>🔧 Weekly Equipment Inspection</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The systematic check that catches equipment issues before they become injuries or downtime.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Cable machines: inspect all cables for fraying, kinking, or wear. Run your hand along the cable (with a cloth) — any roughness means it needs replacement. Check pulleys for smooth operation and unusual noise.</li>
                <li>Weight machines: check all bolts and pins for tightness. Sit on each machine and move through the range of motion — any grinding, sticking, or unusual resistance? Check seat and pad adjustments lock securely.</li>
                <li>Free weights: inspect dumbbells and barbells for loose heads, bent bars, or cracked rubber coating. Check weight plates for cracks. Verify the weight tree and rack are stable and not wobbling.</li>
                <li>Cardio equipment: run each treadmill, bike, elliptical, and rower for 60 seconds. Check for unusual noises, belt tracking (treadmills), resistance accuracy, and display function. Note any error codes.</li>
                <li>Benches and racks: check all adjustable positions lock firmly. Wobble test every bench. Check squat rack safety pins, J-hooks, and pull-up bar mounts for secure attachment.</li>
                <li>Tag any equipment that fails inspection immediately — "OUT OF ORDER" tag visible from all angles. Don't let members use questionable equipment while waiting for repair. Log the issue and schedule the repair.</li>
                <li>Record all inspection results in the equipment maintenance log. Track recurring issues — a machine that needs the same repair monthly probably needs replacement, not another fix.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>☀️ Opening & Closing Procedures</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The bookend routines that start and finish every day properly.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Opening: arrive 30 minutes before doors open. Disarm security system. Turn on all lights — floor, locker rooms, office, exterior signage. Set HVAC to operating temperature.</li>
                <li>Walk the entire facility. Check for anything unusual overnight — water leaks, broken equipment, security issues. If anything is wrong, address it before members arrive.</li>
                <li>Quick visual check of all equipment — nothing obviously broken, all weight plates racked, benches in starting positions. Turn on cardio equipment screens and TVs.</li>
                <li>Check locker rooms: clean, stocked, no overnight issues. Turn on saunas and steam rooms if they need preheat time. Verify water fountains are working.</li>
                <li>Set up the front desk: POS system on, check-in system running, any printed schedules or class rosters ready, phone forwarding active. Review the day's class schedule and confirm instructors.</li>
                <li>Closing: announce last call 15 minutes before close. Politely clear the floor and locker rooms at closing time — don't let members linger indefinitely.</li>
                <li>Complete end-of-day cleaning per the cleaning checklists. Turn off all non-essential equipment and lights. Set HVAC to overnight mode. Arm security system. Lock all doors and verify they're secure.</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Gym SOPs That Actually Get Used</h2>
        <p>Gym staff are on their feet moving around a large space all day. They're not going to sit down and read procedures — they need quick, specific checklists they can pull up on their phone while they're on the floor. One checklist per task: cleaning, equipment inspection, opening, closing. Keep them separate and scannable.</p>
        <p>Frequency matters as much as the task. "Clean the locker rooms" doesn't tell your staff anything. "Check locker rooms every 2 hours, deep clean at close" sets clear expectations they can follow and you can verify.</p>
        <p>Equipment inspections save you money. A $50 cable replacement done proactively is a lot cheaper than a broken machine that's down for a week plus an injury claim. Make inspections a non-negotiable weekly routine, not something that happens when someone notices a problem.</p>

        <h2>Other Procedures Worth Documenting</h2>
        <p>Beyond daily operations, there are a few other areas where written procedures pay off: new member orientation and facility tour, personal training session protocols, group class setup and breakdown, member incident and injury response, membership cancellation and billing handling, and lost-and-found procedures. Each one ensures consistency and reduces the decisions your staff has to make independently.</p>
