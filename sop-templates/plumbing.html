        <p>Step-by-step procedures so every plumber handles the job the same way — whether you're on site or not.</p>

        <h2>Why Your Plumbing Business Needs SOPs</h2>
        <p>Plumbing work is hands-on and high-stakes. A missed step on a water heater install can mean a flooded basement. A sloppy service call can mean a bad review that shows up for years. When your crew is spread across town on different jobs, you need a way to make sure every plumber is doing the work the way you'd do it yourself.</p>
        <p>For plumbing companies with 10 to 30 employees, the challenge is consistent quality without constant oversight. Your senior guys know the process cold, but your newer techs are still learning. SOPs bridge that gap — they give every plumber the same checklist to follow, and they cut the "hey boss, what do I do here?" calls in half.</p>

        <h2>Essential Plumbing SOP Templates</h2>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>🚐 Standard Service Call Procedure</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The complete process for a residential plumbing service call from dispatch to payment.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Review the work order before leaving the shop. Note the problem description, address, access instructions, and any customer history.</li>
                <li>Text the customer your name and ETA when you're 15 minutes away.</li>
                <li>Arrive on time. Lay down a floor mat at the entry. Introduce yourself and ask the customer to walk you to the problem.</li>
                <li>Assess the issue. Turn on fixtures, check water pressure, inspect visible piping, and run the camera if needed. Don't start diagnosing out loud until you've seen everything.</li>
                <li>Explain the problem in plain language. Present repair options with pricing — always give at least two options when possible. Get verbal approval before starting work.</li>
                <li>Shut off the water supply to the affected area before beginning any repair. Confirm it's off by opening the fixture.</li>
                <li>Complete the repair. Test thoroughly — run water for at least 2 minutes and check all connections for drips. Look under and behind the work area.</li>
                <li>Clean the work area completely. Wipe up any water. Remove all old parts and packaging.</li>
                <li>Walk the customer through what you repaired and any maintenance they should do. Point out the shut-off valve location for future reference.</li>
                <li>Collect payment or confirm billing method. Close the work order before leaving.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>🚰 Water Heater Installation Checklist</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">Complete procedure for residential tank or tankless water heater replacement.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Verify the replacement unit matches the proposal — check model number, fuel type (gas/electric), capacity, and venting requirements before loading the truck.</li>
                <li>Lay down drop cloths and floor protection from the entry to the installation location.</li>
                <li>Shut off water supply and gas/electric to the existing unit. For gas units, cap the gas line and verify no smell after capping.</li>
                <li>Drain the old tank completely. Connect a hose and route to a drain or exterior. Wait until flow stops — this takes 15-30 minutes for a full tank.</li>
                <li>Disconnect and remove the old unit. Inspect the pan, connections, and venting for damage that needs to be addressed before installing the new unit.</li>
                <li>Position the new unit. Verify clearances meet code — typically 12 inches from combustible materials for gas units. Level the unit.</li>
                <li>Connect water lines. Use dielectric unions to prevent galvanic corrosion between dissimilar metals. Install expansion tank if required by code.</li>
                <li>For gas units: connect gas line, test every joint with leak detection solution, check for bubbles. Zero tolerance — any bubbles means re-do the connection.</li>
                <li>Fill the tank completely before powering on. Open a hot water faucet upstairs and wait for a steady stream with no air sputtering.</li>
                <li>Set the thermostat to 120°F. Light the pilot or energize the unit. Run hot water at the nearest fixture and verify heating within 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Walk the homeowner through the new unit — thermostat adjustment, emergency shut-off location, maintenance schedule (annual flush), and warranty details.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>🚨 Emergency Leak Response</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">Priority procedure when a customer reports active water damage.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Dispatch asks: Is water actively flowing? Is it near electrical panels or outlets? How long has it been leaking? This determines priority and safety precautions.</li>
                <li>Talk the customer through shutting off the main water valve immediately. Walk them through finding it if they don't know where it is — usually near the water meter or where the main line enters the house.</li>
                <li>Dispatch the nearest available tech. Target: on-site within 90 minutes for active leaks.</li>
                <li>On arrival, confirm water is off. If it's not, locate and shut the main valve yourself before anything else.</li>
                <li>Identify the leak source. Common culprits: burst supply lines, failed water heater, broken hose bibs in winter, corroded drain lines.</li>
                <li>Make the emergency repair to stop the leak. This may be a temporary fix — communicate clearly if a permanent repair will require a follow-up visit.</li>
                <li>Document the damage with photos before and after. The customer may need these for insurance.</li>
                <li>Advise the customer on water damage next steps — suggest they contact their insurance and a water mitigation company if damage is significant.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>🔍 Drain Cleaning Procedure</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">Standard workflow for residential drain clearing — kitchen, bathroom, or main line.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Identify the affected drain(s). Ask the customer: is it one fixture, multiple fixtures, or everything in the house? This tells you whether it's a branch or main line issue.</li>
                <li>Attempt a basic clear first — plunger for toilets, drain snake for sink and tub drains. Try the simplest approach before escalating to power equipment.</li>
                <li>If snaking is needed, lay down protective covering under the work area. Drain clearing gets messy — protect the customer's floors and cabinets.</li>
                <li>Run the snake until you feel the clog break free. Pull back and check the cable end — note what was causing the blockage (grease, roots, debris, foreign object).</li>
                <li>Test the drain by running water for at least 3 minutes. Watch for any slow drainage that indicates a partial blockage remains.</li>
                <li>If the line won't clear with a standard snake, recommend a camera inspection before escalating to hydro-jetting or excavation. Never quote a bigger job without visual confirmation.</li>
                <li>Clean equipment and the work area thoroughly. Show the customer what you pulled from the drain if appropriate — it helps them understand what caused the problem and how to prevent it.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Build your plumbing SOPs now</h3>
            <p>Start with one procedure, share it with your crew, and stop answering the same questions on every job.</p>
            <a href="/" class="tp-cta-btn">Start building — it's free</a>
            <p class="tp-cta-note">No signup required. No credit card. Just start.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Making SOPs Work on the Job Site</h2>
        <p>Your plumbers aren't working at desks — they're under sinks, in crawl spaces, and standing in basements. SOPs need to be accessible on a phone screen with one hand. Keep steps short and specific. Break complicated procedures into numbered steps a first-year apprentice could follow without calling the shop.</p>
        <p>WithoutMe works on any phone browser — your crew clicks a link, sees the procedure, and checks off steps as they go. No app to download, no account to create. That means even a sub or a new hire on their first day can access your procedures.</p>

        <h2>Other Plumbing Procedures Worth Documenting</h2>
        <p>Beyond the core templates above, most plumbing companies benefit from SOPs for: fixture rough-in dimensions, gas line testing protocols, backflow preventer testing, vehicle stocking lists, new hire ride-along checklist, customer follow-up process, and warranty claim procedures. Each documented procedure is one less phone call interrupting your day.</p>

        <div class="tp-cta-box">
            <h3>Your crew shouldn't need to call you to know what to do</h3>
