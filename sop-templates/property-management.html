        <h2>Why Property Managers Need Written Checklists</h2>
        <p>Property management runs on consistency. Every missed inspection item is a potential liability. Every inconsistent move-out assessment leads to deposit disputes. Every maintenance request handled differently creates confusion and tenant frustration. Written checklists keep your team — whether that's two property managers or twenty — handling every situation the same way.</p>
        <p>These procedures cover the core workflows property management companies deal with daily. Adapt them to your portfolio size, your local regulations, and the way your team operates.</p>

            <h3>📋 Move-In Inspection Checklist</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The room-by-room inspection performed before handing over keys — protects you and the tenant.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Schedule the inspection with the tenant present whenever possible. Both parties seeing the same conditions prevents disputes at move-out. If the tenant can't attend, photograph everything.</li>
                <li>Start at the front door. Check the door, frame, lock, deadbolt, doorbell, and any entry-area lighting. Note scuffs, dents, or damage on the inspection form with photos.</li>
                <li>Each room — check and document: walls (nail holes, scuffs, paint condition), ceilings (stains, cracks), flooring (carpet stains, hardwood scratches, tile cracks), windows (operation, screens, locks, blinds condition), and light fixtures.</li>
                <li>Kitchen: test all appliances — oven, stovetop burners, dishwasher cycle, garbage disposal, refrigerator and freezer temperature. Check under the sink for leaks. Run the faucet and check water pressure and drainage.</li>
                <li>Bathrooms: flush all toilets, run all faucets, test the shower, check for leaks around the base of toilets and under sinks. Note caulking condition around tubs and showers. Check exhaust fan operation.</li>
                <li>Test all smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors. Check that fire extinguisher is present and charged if required. Test GFCI outlets in kitchen and bathrooms — press the test button, then reset.</li>
                <li>Check HVAC: run both heat and AC, verify air comes from all vents, note the filter condition. Check the thermostat operation. Test the water heater — hot water should reach the farthest fixture within reasonable time.</li>
                <li>Exterior (if applicable): check patio, balcony, garage, parking spot, storage unit. Note condition of fencing, gates, and any shared amenities the tenant has access to.</li>
                <li>Both parties sign the completed inspection form. Give the tenant a copy immediately. File the original — you'll need it at move-out.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>🔧 Maintenance Request Handling Procedure</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">How every maintenance request gets triaged, assigned, and completed — from first contact to close-out.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Log the request immediately — tenant name, unit, date, description of the issue, and how they reported it (phone, email, portal). Don't rely on memory or sticky notes.</li>
                <li>Triage urgency. Emergency (water leak, no heat in winter, broken lock, gas smell): dispatch same day. Urgent (no hot water, appliance failure, AC out in summer): schedule within 24-48 hours. Routine (dripping faucet, cosmetic issues, minor repairs): schedule within 5-7 business days.</li>
                <li>Notify the tenant of the timeline and who will be entering the unit. Provide the required advance notice per your lease and local law — typically 24-48 hours except for emergencies.</li>
                <li>Assign to the appropriate vendor or in-house maintenance. Include: unit number, access instructions, description of the issue, tenant contact info, and any relevant history ("this is the third time this toilet has been reported").</li>
                <li>After completion, confirm with the tenant that the issue is resolved. Don't close the request based on the vendor saying it's done — the tenant's confirmation is what matters.</li>
                <li>Document the resolution: what was found, what was done, parts used, cost, and whether this is a recurring issue that needs a bigger fix. Update the property maintenance log.</li>
                <li>If the issue is tenant-caused damage, document it clearly with photos before and after repair. Note it in the tenant file for lease renewal and move-out reference.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>🔄 Tenant Turnover & Unit Make-Ready</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The procedure between one tenant moving out and the next one moving in — where vacancy costs add up fast.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Conduct the move-out inspection within 24 hours of the tenant vacating. Compare current condition to the move-in inspection form and photos. Note all damage beyond normal wear and tear.</li>
                <li>Photograph everything — damage and clean areas both. This documentation supports deposit deductions and protects against disputes. Date-stamped photos are your best defense.</li>
                <li>Process the security deposit per your state's legal timeline. Itemize any deductions with descriptions and costs. Send the accounting and any refund within the required days — late deposit returns have legal consequences in most states.</li>
                <li>Create the make-ready scope: paint needed (touch-up or full), carpet cleaning or replacement, appliance repair or replacement, fixtures to fix, deep cleaning, and any deferred maintenance you've been waiting to address.</li>
                <li>Schedule vendors in the right order: repairs first, then paint, then carpet, then deep clean. Don't schedule cleaning before paint — overspray and dust from repairs undo the cleaning.</li>
                <li>Replace all locks and rekey the unit. This is non-negotiable between tenants. Replace smoke detector batteries and HVAC filters as standard practice.</li>
                <li>Final walkthrough before listing: every item on the make-ready scope completed, unit is spotless, all systems working, all keys and remotes accounted for. If you wouldn't be happy moving in, it's not ready.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="tp-sop-card">
            <h3>🔍 Routine Property Inspection</h3>
            <p class="tp-sop-desc">The periodic inspection that catches problems early — before they become expensive repairs or lease violations.</p>
            <ol class="tp-sop-steps">
                <li>Provide proper written notice per your lease terms and local law. Specify the date, approximate time window, and purpose of the inspection. Keep a copy of the notice for your records.</li>
                <li>Exterior first: check the roof (from ground level — look for missing shingles, sagging), gutters, siding, foundation cracks, landscaping condition, and parking areas. Note any code violations or HOA issues.</li>
                <li>Common areas (multi-unit): hallway lighting, fire extinguishers current, exit signs illuminated, stairways clear, laundry room condition, mailbox area secure.</li>
                <li>Inside each unit: look for lease violations (unauthorized pets, occupants, smoking evidence), unreported damage, water damage on ceilings and walls, mold indicators, and safety hazards.</li>
                <li>Check HVAC filters — dirty filters are the most common maintenance issue and lead to system failures. Check under sinks and around water heaters for leaks. Test smoke and CO detectors.</li>
                <li>Note any tenant requests during the visit. Being responsive during inspections builds tenant goodwill and surfaces issues they might not bother to report through normal channels.</li>
                <li>Document findings with photos and notes. Anything requiring follow-up gets entered as a maintenance request immediately — don't let inspection notes sit in a folder.</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Property Management SOPs That Actually Get Used</h2>
        <p>Property managers juggle dozens of units and tenants. Your checklists need to be fast to access and easy to follow on-site. Separate checklists for separate tasks — don't bundle a move-in inspection with a maintenance procedure in the same document. Your team needs to pull up exactly what they need, when they need it.</p>
        <p>Include your legal requirements directly in the checklist. "Provide notice per local law" is useless in the field. "Provide written notice 48 hours minimum — required by state statute" tells your team exactly what's needed. When legal compliance is built into the checklist, compliance happens automatically.</p>
        <p>Photo documentation should be a specific step in every procedure, not an afterthought. The best inspection in the world is worthless if you can't prove what you found. Make "photograph this" an explicit checklist item, not an assumption.</p>

        <h2>Other Procedures Worth Documenting</h2>
        <p>Beyond inspections and maintenance, most property management companies benefit from documenting: tenant screening and application processing, lease renewal procedures, rent collection and late payment handling, vendor management and bidding, emergency response (fire, flood, break-in), and eviction processing. Each one removes inconsistency and protects your company from liability.</p>
